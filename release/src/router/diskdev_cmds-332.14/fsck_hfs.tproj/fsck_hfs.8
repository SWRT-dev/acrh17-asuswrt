.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs standard HFS and HFS+ file systems.
.Pp
The first form of
.Nm
quickly checks the specified file systems to determine whether
they were cleanly unmounted.
.Pp
The second form of
.Nm
preens the specified file systems.
It is normally started by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Pa /etc/rc.boot
during automatic reboot, when a HFS file system is detected.
When preening file systems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies for file systems that were not
unmounted cleanly.
If more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The third form of
.Nm
checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies.
.Pp
If no options are specified 
.Nm
will always check and attempt to fix the specified file systems.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -hang -offset indent
.It Fl d
Display debugging information.
This option may provide useful information when 
.Nm
cannot repair a damaged file system.
.It Fl f
When used with the
.Fl p
option, force
.Nm
to check `clean' file systems, otherwise it means force
.Nm
to check and repair journaled HFS+ file systems.
.It Fl g
Causes
.Nm
to generate it's output strings in GUI format.
This option is used when another application with a graphical user interface
(like Mac OS X Disk Utility) is envoking the
.Nm
tool.
.It Fl l
Lock down the file system and perform a test-only check.
This makes it possible to check a file system that is currently mounted,
although no repairs can be made.
.It Fl m Ar mode
Mode is an octal number that will be used to set the permissions for the
lost+found directory when it is created.
The lost+found directory is only created when a volume is repaired and orphaned
files or directories are detected.
.Nm
places orphaned files and directories into the lost+found directory (located
at the root of the volume).
The default mode is 01777.
.It Fl p
Preen the specified file systems.
.It Fl q
Causes
.Nm
to quickly check whether the volume was unmounted cleanly.
If the volume was unmounted cleanly, then the exit status is 0.
If the volume was not unmounted cleanly, then the exit status will be non-zero.
In either case, a message is printed to standard output describing whether the
volume was clean or dirty.
.It Fl y
Always attempt to repair any damage that is found.
.It Fl n
Never attempt to repair any damage that is found.
.It Fl r
Rebuild the catalog file on the specified file system.
This option currently will only work if there is enough contiguous space on the
specified file system for a new catalog file and if there is no damage 
to the leaf nodes in the existing catalog file.
.El
.Pp
Because of inconsistencies between the block device and the buffer cache,
the raw device should always be used.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr fsck 8
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
is not able to fix some inconsistencies that it detects.
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command appeared in Mac OS X Server 1.0 .
