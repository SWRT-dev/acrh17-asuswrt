"Why can't you see your files?\r\
\r\
This hard disk is formatted with the Mac OS Extended format. Your files and \
information are still on the hard disk, but you cannot access them with the \
version of system software you are using.\r\
\r\
How can you access your files?\r\
\r\
To access your files you must mount this hard disk on a computer that has \
Mac OS 8.1 or later installed. To determine the version of system software \
you’re currently using, choose About This Computer from the Apple menu. If \
you’re using a version of the Mac OS earlier than 8.1, you must do one of the \
following: A) upgrade the system software on your computer, B) start up the \
computer from a hard disk or CD that has Mac OS 8.1 or later, or C) connect \
the hard disk to another computer with Mac OS 8.1 or later installed.\r\
\r\
If you want to access the files without upgrading your system software, \
start up your computer with the “Mac OS 8.1” CD or the “Disk Tools PPC” \
disk, then access your files. Apple recommends that you have the “Mac OS \
8.1” CD if you plan to reformat any hard disk using Mac OS Extended format.\r\
\r\
To continue to use this hard disk with this computer, you must upgrade your \
system software to Mac OS 8.1.\r\
\r\
How do you upgrade your system software?\r\
\r\
If you have a version of system software earlier than Mac OS 8, you can order \
Mac OS 8.1 on the Internet or buy it at a local Apple software reseller.\r\
\r\
If you have Mac OS 8 on your computer, you can download the Mac OS 8.1 \
update from the Internet at http://www.info.apple.com.\r\
