.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm /sbin/mountd
.Op Fl nrDd
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Xr Mountd
is the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from NFS clients.
.Xr Mountd
listens for service requests at a port registered with
.Xr portmap 8 .
.Pp
For a definition of the MOUNT protocol see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I.
.Pp
Options and operands available for
.Nm mountd :
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl n
The
.Fl n
option allows non-root mount requests to be served.
This should only be specified if there are clients such as PC's,
that require it.
.It Fl r
The
.Fl r
option allows mount RPCs requests for regular files to be served.
Although this seems to violate the mount protocol specification,
some diskless workstations do mount requests for
their swapfiles and expect them to be regular files.
Since a regular file cannot be specified in
.Pa /etc/exports ,
the entire file system in which the swapfiles resides
will have to be exported with the
.Fl alldirs
flag.
.It Fl D
The
.Fl D
option will cause mountd to log lots of information about its
inner-workings via
.Xr syslog 3
using the LOG_DAEMON facility and the LOG_DEBUG priority.
.It Fl d
The
.Fl d
option will cause mountd to not daemonize itself and it will
log lots of information about its inner-workings to stderr
instead of
.Xr syslog 3 .
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When mountd is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the
.Xr nfssvc 2
system call.
After changing the list of exports (either directly or indirectly
via a change in netgroup membership), a hangup signal should be
sent to the mountd daemon to get it to reload the export information:
.Pp
.Dl "kill \-s HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`
.Pp
Any errors encountered while processing the export entries will
be logged via
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
the list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
the pid of the currently running mountd
.It Pa /var/run/mountdtab
the current list of outstanding mounts served
.It Pa /var/run/mountdexptab
information about exported file systems
and directories (UUIDs, handles, ...)
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr exports 5 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr portmap 8 ,
.Xr showmount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm mountd
utility first appeared in 4.4BSD.
