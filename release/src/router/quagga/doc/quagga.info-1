1 Overview
**********

Quagga is a routing software package that provides TCP/IP based routing
services with routing protocols support such as RIPv1, RIPv2, RIPng,
OSPFv2, OSPFv3, IS-IS, BGP-4, and BGP-4+ (*note Supported RFCs::).
Quagga also supports special BGP Route Reflector and Route Server
behavior.  In addition to traditional IPv4 routing protocols, Quagga
also supports IPv6 routing protocols.  With SNMP daemon which supports
SMUX and AgentX protocol, Quagga provides routing protocol MIBs (*note
SNMP Support::).

   Quagga uses an advanced software architecture to provide you with a
high quality, multi server routing engine.  Quagga has an interactive
user interface for each routing protocol and supports common client
commands.  Due to this design, you can add new protocol daemons to
Quagga easily.  You can use Quagga library as your program's client user
interface.

   Quagga is distributed under the GNU General Public License.

1.1 About Quagga
================

Today, TCP/IP networks are covering all of the world.  The Internet has
been deployed in many countries, companies, and to the home.  When you
connect to the Internet your packet will pass many routers which have
TCP/IP routing functionality.

   A system with Quagga installed acts as a dedicated router.  With
Quagga, your machine exchanges routing information with other routers
using routing protocols.  Quagga uses this information to update the
kernel routing table so that the right data goes to the right place.
You can dynamically change the configuration and you may view routing
table information from the Quagga terminal interface.

   Adding to routing protocol support, Quagga can setup interface's
flags, interface's address, static routes and so on.  If you have a
small network, or a stub network, or xDSL connection, configuring the
Quagga routing software is very easy.  The only thing you have to do is
to set up the interfaces and put a few commands about static routes
and/or default routes.  If the network is rather large, or if the
network structure changes frequently, you will want to take advantage of
Quagga's dynamic routing protocol support for protocols such as RIP,
OSPF, IS-IS or BGP.

   Traditionally, UNIX based router configuration is done by 'ifconfig'
and 'route' commands.  Status of routing table is displayed by 'netstat'
utility.  Almost of these commands work only if the user has root
privileges.  Quagga has a different system administration method.  There
are two user modes in Quagga.  One is normal mode, the other is enable
mode.  Normal mode user can only view system status, enable mode user
can change system configuration.  This UNIX account independent feature
will be great help to the router administrator.

   Currently, Quagga supports common unicast routing protocols, that is
BGP, OSPF, RIP and IS-IS. Upcoming for MPLS support, an implementation
of LDP is currently being prepared for merging.  Implementations of BFD
and PIM-SSM (IPv4) also exist, but are not actively being worked on.

   The ultimate goal of the Quagga project is making a productive,
quality, free TCP/IP routing software package.

1.2 System Architecture
=======================

Traditional routing software is made as a one process program which
provides all of the routing protocol functionalities.  Quagga takes a
different approach.  It is made from a collection of several daemons
that work together to build the routing table.  There may be several
protocol-specific routing daemons and zebra the kernel routing manager.

   The 'ripd' daemon handles the RIP protocol, while 'ospfd' is a daemon
which supports OSPF version 2.  'bgpd' supports the BGP-4 protocol.  For
changing the kernel routing table and for redistribution of routes
between different routing protocols, there is a kernel routing table
manager 'zebra' daemon.  It is easy to add a new routing protocol
daemons to the entire routing system without affecting any other
software.  You need to run only the protocol daemon associated with
routing protocols in use.  Thus, user may run a specific daemon and send
routing reports to a central routing console.

   There is no need for these daemons to be running on the same machine.
You can even run several same protocol daemons on the same machine.
This architecture creates new possibilities for the routing system.

     +----+  +----+  +-----+  +-----+
     |bgpd|  |ripd|  |ospfd|  |zebra|
     +----+  +----+  +-----+  +-----+
                                 |
     +---------------------------|--+
     |                           v  |
     |  UNIX Kernel  routing table  |
     |                              |
     +------------------------------+

         Quagga System Architecture

   Multi-process architecture brings extensibility, modularity and
maintainability.  At the same time it also brings many configuration
files and terminal interfaces.  Each daemon has it's own configuration
file and terminal interface.  When you configure a static route, it must
be done in 'zebra' configuration file.  When you configure BGP network
it must be done in 'bgpd' configuration file.  This can be a very
annoying thing.  To resolve the problem, Quagga provides integrated user
interface shell called 'vtysh'.  'vtysh' connects to each daemon with
UNIX domain socket and then works as a proxy for user input.

   Quagga was planned to use multi-threaded mechanism when it runs with
a kernel that supports multi-threads.  But at the moment, the thread
library which comes with GNU/Linux or FreeBSD has some problems with
running reliable services such as routing software, so we don't use
threads at all.  Instead we use the 'select(2)' system call for
multiplexing the events.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Supported Platforms,  Next: Supported RFCs,  Prev: System Architecture,  Up: Overview

1.3 Supported Platforms
=======================

Currently Quagga supports GNU/Linux and BSD. Porting Quagga to other
platforms is not too difficult as platform dependent code should most be
limited to the 'zebra' daemon.  Protocol daemons are mostly platform
independent.  Please let us know when you find out Quagga runs on a
platform which is not listed below.

   The list of officially supported platforms are listed below.  Note
that Quagga may run correctly on other platforms, and may run with
partial functionality on further platforms.


   * GNU/Linux
   * FreeBSD
   * NetBSD
   * OpenBSD

   Versions of these platforms that are older than around 2 years from
the point of their original release (in case of GNU/Linux, this is since
the kernel's release on kernel.org) may need some work.  Similarly, the
following platforms may work with some effort:


   * Solaris
   * Mac OSX

   Also note that, in particular regarding proprietary platforms,
compiler and C library choice will affect Quagga.  Only recent versions
of the following C compilers are well-tested:


   * GNU's GCC
   * LLVM's clang
   * Intel's ICC

File: quagga.info,  Node: The Configure script and its options,  Next: Least-Privilege support,  Up: Configure the Software

2.1.1 The Configure script and its options
------------------------------------------

Quagga has an excellent configure script which automatically detects
most host configurations.  There are several additional configure
options you can use to turn off IPv6 support, to disable the compilation
of specific daemons, and to enable SNMP support.

'--disable-ipv6'
     Turn off IPv6 related features and daemons.  Quagga configure
     script automatically detects IPv6 stack.  But sometimes you might
     want to disable IPv6 support of Quagga.
'--disable-zebra'
     Do not build zebra daemon.
'--disable-ripd'
     Do not build ripd.
'--disable-ripngd'
     Do not build ripngd.
'--disable-ospfd'
     Do not build ospfd.
'--disable-ospf6d'
     Do not build ospf6d.
'--disable-bgpd'
     Do not build bgpd.
'--disable-bgp-announce'
     Make 'bgpd' which does not make bgp announcements at all.  This
     feature is good for using 'bgpd' as a BGP announcement listener.
'--enable-netlink'
     Force to enable GNU/Linux netlink interface.  Quagga configure
     script detects netlink interface by checking a header file.  When
     the header file does not match to the current running kernel,
     configure script will not turn on netlink support.
'--enable-snmp'
     Enable SNMP support.  By default, SNMP support is disabled.
'--disable-opaque-lsa'
     Disable support for Opaque LSAs (RFC2370) in ospfd.
'--disable-ospfapi'
     Disable support for OSPF-API, an API to interface directly with
     ospfd.  OSPF-API is enabled if -enable-opaque-lsa is set.
'--disable-ospfclient'
     Disable building of the example OSPF-API client.
'--disable-ospf-te'
     Disable support for OSPF Traffic Engineering Extension
     (internet-draft) this requires support for Opaque LSAs.
'--enable-multipath=ARG'
     Enable support for Equal Cost Multipath.  ARG is the maximum number
     of ECMP paths to allow, set to 0 to allow unlimited number of
     paths.
'--disable-rtadv'
     Disable support IPV6 router advertisement in zebra.
'--enable-gcc-rdynamic'
     Pass the '-rdynamic' option to the linker driver.  This is in most
     cases neccessary for getting usable backtraces.  This option
     defaults to on if the compiler is detected as gcc, but giving an
     explicit enable/disable is suggested.
'--enable-backtrace'
     Controls backtrace support for the crash handlers.  This is
     autodetected by default.  Using the switch will enforce the
     requested behaviour, failing with an error if support is requested
     but not available.  On BSD systems, this needs libexecinfo, while
     on glibc support for this is part of libc itself.

   You may specify any combination of the above options to the configure
script.  By default, the executables are placed in '/usr/local/sbin' and
the configuration files in '/usr/local/etc'.  The '/usr/local/'
installation prefix and other directories may be changed using the
following options to the configuration script.

'--prefix=PREFIX'
     Install architecture-independent files in PREFIX [/usr/local].
'--sysconfdir=DIR'
     Look for configuration files in DIR [PREFIX/etc].  Note that sample
     configuration files will be installed here.
'--localstatedir=DIR'
     Configure zebra to use DIR for local state files, such as pid files
     and unix sockets.

     % ./configure --disable-ipv6

   This command will configure zebra and the routing daemons.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Least-Privilege support,  Next: Linux notes,  Prev: The Configure script and its options,  Up: Configure the Software

2.1.2 Least-Privilege support
-----------------------------

Additionally, you may configure zebra to drop its elevated privileges
shortly after startup and switch to another user.  The configure script
will automatically try to configure this support.  There are three
configure options to control the behaviour of Quagga daemons.

'--enable-user=USER'
     Switch to user ARG shortly after startup, and run as user ARG in
     normal operation.
'--enable-group=GROUP'
     Switch real and effective group to GROUP shortly after startup.
'--enable-vty-group=GROUP'
     Create Unix Vty sockets (for use with vtysh) with group owndership
     set to GROUP.  This allows one to create a seperate group which is
     restricted to accessing only the Vty sockets, hence allowing one to
     delegate this group to individual users, or to run vtysh setgid to
     this group.

   The default user and group which will be configured is 'quagga' if no
user or group is specified.  Note that this user or group requires write
access to the local state directory (see -localstatedir) and requires at
least read access, and write access if you wish to allow daemons to
write out their configuration, to the configuration directory (see
-sysconfdir).

   On systems which have the 'libcap' capabilities manipulation library
(currently only linux), the quagga system will retain only minimal
capabilities required, further it will only raise these capabilities for
brief periods.  On systems without libcap, quagga will run as the user
specified and only raise its uid back to uid 0 for brief periods.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Linux notes,  Prev: Least-Privilege support,  Up: Configure the Software

2.1.3 Linux Notes
-----------------

There are several options available only to GNU/Linux systems: (1).  If
you use GNU/Linux, make sure that the current kernel configuration is
what you want.  Quagga will run with any kernel configuration but some
recommendations do exist.

CONFIG_NETLINK
     Kernel/User netlink socket.  This is a brand new feature which
     enables an advanced interface between the Linux kernel and zebra
     (*note Kernel Interface::).

CONFIG_RTNETLINK
     Routing messages.  This makes it possible to receive netlink
     routing messages.  If you specify this option, 'zebra' can detect
     routing information updates directly from the kernel (*note Kernel
     Interface::).

CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST
     IP: multicasting.  This option should be specified when you use
     'ripd' (*note RIP::) or 'ospfd' (*note OSPFv2::) because these
     protocols use multicast.

   IPv6 support has been added in GNU/Linux kernel version 2.2.  If you
try to use the Quagga IPv6 feature on a GNU/Linux kernel, please make
sure the following libraries have been installed.  Please note that
these libraries will not be needed when you uses GNU C library 2.1 or
upper.

'inet6-apps'
     The 'inet6-apps' package includes basic IPv6 related libraries such
     as 'inet_ntop' and 'inet_pton'.  Some basic IPv6 programs such as
     'ping', 'ftp', and 'inetd' are also included.  The 'inet-apps' can
     be found at <ftp://ftp.inner.net/pub/ipv6/>.

'net-tools'
     The 'net-tools' package provides an IPv6 enabled interface and
     routing utility.  It contains 'ifconfig', 'route', 'netstat', and
     other tools.  'net-tools' may be found at
     <http://www.tazenda.demon.co.uk/phil/net-tools/>.

File: quagga.info,  Node: Build the Software,  Next: Install the Software,  Prev: Configure the Software,  Up: Installation

2.2 Build the Software
======================

After configuring the software, you will need to compile it for your
system.  Simply issue the command 'make' in the root of the source
directory and the software will be compiled.  If you have *any* problems
at this stage, be certain to send a bug report *Note Bug Reports::.

     % ./configure
     .
     .
     .
     ./configure output
     .
     .
     .
     % make


File: quagga.info,  Node: Install the Software,  Prev: Build the Software,  Up: Installation

2.3 Install the Software
========================

Installing the software to your system consists of copying the compiled
programs and supporting files to a standard location.  After the
installation process has completed, these files have been copied from
your work directory to '/usr/local/bin', and '/usr/local/etc'.

   To install the Quagga suite, issue the following command at your
shell prompt: 'make install'.

     %
     % make install
     %

   Quagga daemons have their own terminal interface or VTY. After
installation, you have to setup each beast's port number to connect to
them.  Please add the following entries to '/etc/services'.

     zebrasrv      2600/tcp		  # zebra service
     zebra         2601/tcp		  # zebra vty
     ripd          2602/tcp		  # RIPd vty
     ripngd        2603/tcp		  # RIPngd vty
     ospfd         2604/tcp		  # OSPFd vty
     bgpd          2605/tcp		  # BGPd vty
     ospf6d        2606/tcp		  # OSPF6d vty
     ospfapi       2607/tcp		  # ospfapi
     isisd         2608/tcp		  # ISISd vty
     pimd          2611/tcp		  # PIMd vty

   If you use a FreeBSD newer than 2.2.8, the above entries are already
added to '/etc/services' so there is no need to add it.  If you specify
a port number when starting the daemon, these entries may not be needed.

   You may need to make changes to the config files in
'/etc/quagga/*.conf'.  *Note Config Commands::.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Basic commands,  Next: Zebra,  Prev: Installation,  Up: Top

3 Basic commands
****************

There are five routing daemons in use, and there is one manager daemon.
These daemons may be located on separate machines from the manager
daemon.  Each of these daemons will listen on a particular port for
incoming VTY connections.  The routing daemons are:

   * 'ripd', 'ripngd', 'ospfd', 'ospf6d', 'bgpd'
   * 'zebra'

   The following sections discuss commands common to all the routing
daemons.

3.1 Config Commands
===================

* Menu:

* Basic Config Commands::       Some of the generic config commands
* Sample Config File::          An example config file

In a config file, you can write the debugging options, a vty's password,
routing daemon configurations, a log file name, and so forth.  This
information forms the initial command set for a routing beast as it is
starting.

   Config files are generally found in:

     '/etc/quagga/*.conf'

   Each of the daemons has its own config file.  For example, zebra's
default config file name is:

     '/etc/quagga/zebra.conf'

   The daemon name plus '.conf' is the default config file name.  You
can specify a config file using the '-f' or '--config-file' options when
starting the daemon.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Basic Config Commands,  Next: Sample Config File,  Up: Config Commands

3.1.1 Basic Config Commands
---------------------------

 -- Command: hostname HOSTNAME
     Set hostname of the router.

 -- Command: password PASSWORD
     Set password for vty interface.  If there is no password, a vty
     won't accept connections.

 -- Command: enable password PASSWORD
     Set enable password.

 -- Command: log trap LEVEL
 -- Command: no log trap
     These commands are deprecated and are present only for historical
     compatibility.  The log trap command sets the current logging level
     for all enabled logging destinations, and it sets the default for
     all future logging commands that do not specify a level.  The
     normal default logging level is debugging.  The 'no' form of the
     command resets the default level for future logging commands to
     debugging, but it does not change the logging level of existing
     logging destinations.

 -- Command: log stdout
 -- Command: log stdout LEVEL
 -- Command: no log stdout
     Enable logging output to stdout.  If the optional second argument
     specifying the logging level is not present, the default logging
     level (typically debugging, but can be changed using the deprecated
     'log trap' command) will be used.  The 'no' form of the command
     disables logging to stdout.  The 'level' argument must have one of
     these values: emergencies, alerts, critical, errors, warnings,
     notifications, informational, or debugging.  Note that the existing
     code logs its most important messages with severity 'errors'.

 -- Command: log file FILENAME
 -- Command: log file FILENAME LEVEL
 -- Command: no log file
     If you want to log into a file, please specify 'filename' as in
     this example:
          log file /var/log/quagga/bgpd.log informational
     If the optional second argument specifying the logging level is not
     present, the default logging level (typically debugging, but can be
     changed using the deprecated 'log trap' command) will be used.  The
     'no' form of the command disables logging to a file.

     Note: if you do not configure any file logging, and a daemon
     crashes due to a signal or an assertion failure, it will attempt to
     save the crash information in a file named /var/tmp/quagga.<daemon
     name>.crashlog.  For security reasons, this will not happen if the
     file exists already, so it is important to delete the file after
     reporting the crash information.

 -- Command: log syslog
 -- Command: log syslog LEVEL
 -- Command: no log syslog
     Enable logging output to syslog.  If the optional second argument
     specifying the logging level is not present, the default logging
     level (typically debugging, but can be changed using the deprecated
     'log trap' command) will be used.  The 'no' form of the command
     disables logging to syslog.

 -- Command: log monitor
 -- Command: log monitor LEVEL
 -- Command: no log monitor
     Enable logging output to vty terminals that have enabled logging
     using the 'terminal monitor' command.  By default, monitor logging
     is enabled at the debugging level, but this command (or the
     deprecated 'log trap' command) can be used to change the monitor
     logging level.  If the optional second argument specifying the
     logging level is not present, the default logging level (typically
     debugging, but can be changed using the deprecated 'log trap'
     command) will be used.  The 'no' form of the command disables
     logging to terminal monitors.

 -- Command: log facility FACILITY
 -- Command: no log facility
     This command changes the facility used in syslog messages.  The
     default facility is 'daemon'.  The 'no' form of the command resets
     the facility to the default 'daemon' facility.

 -- Command: log record-priority
 -- Command: no log record-priority
     To include the severity in all messages logged to a file, to
     stdout, or to a terminal monitor (i.e.  anything except syslog),
     use the 'log record-priority' global configuration command.  To
     disable this option, use the 'no' form of the command.  By default,
     the severity level is not included in logged messages.  Note: some
     versions of syslogd (including Solaris) can be configured to
     include the facility and level in the messages emitted.

 -- Command: log timestamp precision <0-6>
 -- Command: no log timestamp precision
     This command sets the precision of log message timestamps to the
     given number of digits after the decimal point.  Currently, the
     value must be in the range 0 to 6 (i.e.  the maximum precision is
     microseconds).  To restore the default behavior (1-second
     accuracy), use the 'no' form of the command, or set the precision
     explicitly to 0.

          log timestamp precision 3

     In this example, the precision is set to provide timestamps with
     millisecond accuracy.

 -- Command: service password-encryption
     Encrypt password.

 -- Command: service advanced-vty
     Enable advanced mode VTY.

 -- Command: service terminal-length <0-512>
     Set system wide line configuration.  This configuration command
     applies to all VTY interfaces.

 -- Command: line vty
     Enter vty configuration mode.

 -- Command: banner motd default
     Set default motd string.

 -- Command: no banner motd
     No motd banner string will be printed.

 -- Line Command: exec-timeout MINUTE
 -- Line Command: exec-timeout MINUTE SECOND
     Set VTY connection timeout value.  When only one argument is
     specified it is used for timeout value in minutes.  Optional second
     argument is used for timeout value in seconds.  Default timeout
     value is 10 minutes.  When timeout value is zero, it means no
     timeout.

 -- Line Command: no exec-timeout
     Do not perform timeout at all.  This command is as same as
     'exec-timeout 0 0'.

 -- Line Command: access-class ACCESS-LIST
     Restrict vty connections with an access list.

3.1.2 Sample Config File
------------------------

Below is a sample configuration file for the zebra daemon.

     !
     ! Zebra configuration file
     !
     hostname Router
     password zebra
     enable password zebra
     !
     log stdout
     !
     !

   '!'  and '#' are comment characters.  If the first character of the
word is one of the comment characters then from the rest of the line
forward will be ignored as a comment.

     password zebra!password

   If a comment character is not the first character of the word, it's a
normal character.  So in the above example '!'  will not be regarded as
a comment and the password is set to 'zebra!password'.

3.2 Terminal Mode Commands
==========================

 -- Command: write terminal
     Displays the current configuration to the vty interface.

 -- Command: write file
     Write current configuration to configuration file.

 -- Command: configure terminal
     Change to configuration mode.  This command is the first step to
     configuration.

 -- Command: terminal length <0-512>
     Set terminal display length to <0-512>.  If length is 0, no display
     control is performed.

 -- Command: who
     Show a list of currently connected vty sessions.

 -- Command: list
     List all available commands.

 -- Command: show version
     Show the current version of Quagga and its build host information.

 -- Command: show logging
     Shows the current configuration of the logging system.  This
     includes the status of all logging destinations.

 -- Command: logmsg LEVEL MESSAGE
     Send a message to all logging destinations that are enabled for
     messages of the given severity.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Common Invocation Options,  Next: Virtual Terminal Interfaces,  Prev: Terminal Mode Commands,  Up: Basic commands

3.3 Common Invocation Options
=============================

These options apply to all Quagga daemons.

'-d'
'--daemon'
     Runs in daemon mode.

'-f FILE'
'--config_file=FILE'
     Set configuration file name.

'-h'
'--help'
     Display this help and exit.

'-i FILE'
'--pid_file=FILE'

     Upon startup the process identifier of the daemon is written to a
     file, typically in '/var/run'.  This file can be used by the init
     system to implement commands such as '.../init.d/zebra status',
     '.../init.d/zebra restart' or '.../init.d/zebra stop'.

     The file name is an run-time option rather than a configure-time
     option so that multiple routing daemons can be run simultaneously.
     This is useful when using Quagga to implement a routing looking
     glass.  One machine can be used to collect differing routing views
     from differing points in the network.

'-A ADDRESS'
'--vty_addr=ADDRESS'
     Set the VTY local address to bind to.  If set, the VTY socket will
     only be bound to this address.

'-P PORT'
'--vty_port=PORT'
     Set the VTY TCP port number.  If set to 0 then the TCP VTY sockets
     will not be opened.

'-u USER'
'--vty_addr=USER'
     Set the user and group to run as.

'-v'
'--version'
     Print program version.

3.4.1 VTY Overview
------------------

VTY stands for Virtual TeletYpe interface.  It means you can connect to
the daemon via the telnet protocol.

   To enable a VTY interface, you have to setup a VTY password.  If
there is no VTY password, one cannot connect to the VTY interface at
all.

     % telnet localhost 2601
     Trying 127.0.0.1...
     Connected to localhost.
     Escape character is '^]'.

4.2 Interface Commands
======================

 -- Command: interface IFNAME

 -- Interface Command: shutdown
 -- Interface Command: no shutdown
     Up or down the current interface.

 -- Interface Command: ip address ADDRESS/PREFIX
 -- Interface Command: ipv6 address ADDRESS/PREFIX
 -- Interface Command: no ip address ADDRESS/PREFIX
 -- Interface Command: no ipv6 address ADDRESS/PREFIX
     Set the IPv4 or IPv6 address/prefix for the interface.

 -- Interface Command: ip address ADDRESS/PREFIX secondary
 -- Interface Command: no ip address ADDRESS/PREFIX secondary
     Set the secondary flag for this address.  This causes ospfd to not
     treat the address as a distinct subnet.

 -- Interface Command: description DESCRIPTION ...
     Set description for the interface.

 -- Interface Command: multicast
 -- Interface Command: no multicast
     Enable or disables multicast flag for the interface.

 -- Interface Command: bandwidth <1-10000000>
 -- Interface Command: no bandwidth <1-10000000>
     Set bandwidth value of the interface in kilobits/sec.  This is for
     calculating OSPF cost.  This command does not affect the actual
     device configuration.

 -- Interface Command: link-detect
 -- Interface Command: no link-detect
     Enable/disable link-detect on platforms which support this.
     Currently only Linux and Solaris, and only where network interface
     drivers support reporting link-state via the IFF_RUNNING flag.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Static Route Commands,  Next: Multicast RIB Commands,  Prev: Interface Commands,  Up: Zebra

4.3 Static Route Commands
=========================

Static routing is a very fundamental feature of routing technology.  It
defines static prefix and gateway.

 -- Command: ip route NETWORK GATEWAY
     NETWORK is destination prefix with format of A.B.C.D/M. GATEWAY is
     gateway for the prefix.  When GATEWAY is A.B.C.D format.  It is
     taken as a IPv4 address gateway.  Otherwise it is treated as an
     interface name.  If the interface name is NULL0 then zebra installs
     a blackhole route.

          ip route 10.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.2
          ip route 10.0.0.0/8 ppp0
          ip route 10.0.0.0/8 null0

     First example defines 10.0.0.0/8 static route with gateway
     10.0.0.2.  Second one defines the same prefix but with gateway to
     interface ppp0.  The third install a blackhole route.

 -- Command: ip route NETWORK NETMASK GATEWAY
     This is alternate version of above command.  When NETWORK is
     A.B.C.D format, user must define NETMASK value with A.B.C.D format.
     GATEWAY is same option as above command

          ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2
          ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 ppp0
          ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 null0

     These statements are equivalent to those in the previous example.

 -- Command: ip route NETWORK GATEWAY DISTANCE
     Installs the route with the specified distance.

   Multiple nexthop static route

     ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.2
     ip route 10.0.0.1/32 10.0.0.3
     ip route 10.0.0.1/32 eth0

   If there is no route to 10.0.0.2 and 10.0.0.3, and interface eth0 is
reachable, then the last route is installed into the kernel.

   If zebra has been compiled with multipath support, and both 10.0.0.2
and 10.0.0.3 are reachable, zebra will install a multipath route via
both nexthops, if the platform supports this.

     zebra> show ip route
     S>  10.0.0.1/32 [1/0] via 10.0.0.2 inactive
                           via 10.0.0.3 inactive
       *                   is directly connected, eth0

     ip route 10.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.2
     ip route 10.0.0.0/8 10.0.0.3
     ip route 10.0.0.0/8 null0 255

   This will install a multihop route via the specified next-hops if
they are reachable, as well as a high-metric blackhole route, which can
be useful to prevent traffic destined for a prefix to match
less-specific routes (eg default) should the specified gateways not be
reachable.  Eg:

     zebra> show ip route 10.0.0.0/8
     Routing entry for 10.0.0.0/8
       Known via "static", distance 1, metric 0
         10.0.0.2 inactive
         10.0.0.3 inactive

     Routing entry for 10.0.0.0/8
       Known via "static", distance 255, metric 0
         directly connected, Null0

 -- Command: ipv6 route NETWORK GATEWAY
 -- Command: ipv6 route NETWORK GATEWAY DISTANCE
     These behave similarly to their ipv4 counterparts.

 -- Command: table TABLENO
     Select the primary kernel routing table to be used.  This only
     works for kernels supporting multiple routing tables (like
     GNU/Linux 2.2.x and later).  After setting TABLENO with this
     command, static routes defined after this are added to the
     specified table.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Multicast RIB Commands,  Next: zebra Route Filtering,  Prev: Static Route Commands,  Up: Zebra

4.4 Multicast RIB Commands
==========================

The Multicast RIB provides a separate table of unicast destinations
which is used for Multicast Reverse Path Forwarding decisions.  It is
used with a multicast source's IP address, hence contains not multicast
group addresses but unicast addresses.

   This table is fully separate from the default unicast table.
However, RPF lookup can include the unicast table.

   WARNING: RPF lookup results are non-responsive in this version of
Quagga, i.e.  multicast routing does not actively react to changes in
underlying unicast topology!

 -- Command: ip multicast rpf-lookup-mode MODE
 -- Command: no ip multicast rpf-lookup-mode [MODE]

     MODE sets the method used to perform RPF lookups.  Supported modes:

     'urib-only'
          Performs the lookup on the Unicast RIB. The Multicast RIB is
          never used.
     'mrib-only'
          Performs the lookup on the Multicast RIB. The Unicast RIB is
          never used.
     'mrib-then-urib'
          Tries to perform the lookup on the Multicast RIB. If any route
          is found, that route is used.  Otherwise, the Unicast RIB is
          tried.
     'lower-distance'
          Performs a lookup on the Multicast RIB and Unicast RIB each.
          The result with the lower administrative distance is used; if
          they're equal, the Multicast RIB takes precedence.
     'longer-prefix'
          Performs a lookup on the Multicast RIB and Unicast RIB each.
          The result with the longer prefix length is used; if they're
          equal, the Multicast RIB takes precedence.

     The 'mrib-then-urib' setting is the default behavior if nothing is
     configured.  If this is the desired behavior, it should be
     explicitly configured to make the configuration immune against
     possible changes in what the default behavior is.

     WARNING: Unreachable routes do not receive special treatment and do
     not cause fallback to a second lookup.

 -- Command: show ip rpf ADDR

     Performs a Multicast RPF lookup, as configured with 'ip multicast
     rpf-lookup-mode MODE'.  ADDR specifies the multicast source address
     to look up.

          > show ip rpf 192.0.2.1
          Routing entry for 192.0.2.0/24 using Unicast RIB
            Known via "kernel", distance 0, metric 0, best
            * 198.51.100.1, via eth0

     Indicates that a multicast source lookup for 192.0.2.1 would use an
     Unicast RIB entry for 192.0.2.0/24 with a gateway of 198.51.100.1.

 -- Command: show ip rpf

     Prints the entire Multicast RIB. Note that this is independent of
     the configured RPF lookup mode, the Multicast RIB may be printed
     yet not used at all.

 -- Command: ip mroute PREFIX NEXTHOP [DISTANCE]
 -- Command: no ip mroute PREFIX NEXTHOP [DISTANCE]

     Adds a static route entry to the Multicast RIB. This performs
     exactly as the 'ip route' command, except that it inserts the route
     in the Multicast RIB instead of the Unicast RIB.

4.5 zebra Route Filtering
=========================

Zebra supports 'prefix-list' and 'route-map' to match routes received
from other quagga components.  The 'permit'/'deny' facilities provided
by these commands can be used to filter which routes zebra will install
in the kernel.

 -- Command: ip protocol PROTOCOL route-map ROUTEMAP
     Apply a route-map filter to routes for the specified protocol.
     PROTOCOL can be any or one of system, kernel, connected, static,
     rip, ripng, ospf, ospf6, isis, bgp, hsls.

 -- Route Map: set src ADDRESS
     Within a route-map, set the preferred source address for matching
     routes when installing in the kernel.

     The following creates a prefix-list that matches all addresses, a route-map
     that sets the preferred source address, and applies the route-map to all
     rip routes.

     ip prefix-list ANY permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
     route-map RM1 permit 10
          match ip address prefix-list ANY
          set src 10.0.0.1

     ip protocol rip route-map RM1

4.6 zebra FIB push interface
============================

Zebra supports a 'FIB push' interface that allows an external component
to learn the forwarding information computed by the Quagga routing
suite.

   In Quagga, the Routing Information Base (RIB) resides inside zebra.
Routing protocols communicate their best routes to zebra, and zebra
computes the best route across protocols for each prefix.  This latter
information makes up the Forwarding Information Base (FIB). Zebra feeds
the FIB to the kernel, which allows the IP stack in the kernel to
forward packets according to the routes computed by Quagga.  The kernel
FIB is updated in an OS-specific way.  For example, the 'netlink'
interface is used on Linux, and route sockets are used on FreeBSD.

   The FIB push interface aims to provide a cross-platform mechanism to
support scenarios where the router has a forwarding path that is
distinct from the kernel, commonly a hardware-based fast path.  In these
cases, the FIB needs to be maintained reliably in the fast path as well.
We refer to the component that programs the forwarding plane (directly
or indirectly) as the Forwarding Plane Manager or FPM.

   The FIB push interface comprises of a TCP connection between zebra
and the FPM. The connection is initiated by zebra - that is, the FPM
acts as the TCP server.

   The relevant zebra code kicks in when zebra is configured with the
'--enable-fpm' flag.  Zebra periodically attempts to connect to the
well-known FPM port.  Once the connection is up, zebra starts sending
messages containing routes over the socket to the FPM. Zebra sends a
complete copy of the forwarding table to the FPM, including routes that
it may have picked up from the kernel.  The existing interaction of
zebra with the kernel remains unchanged - that is, the kernel continues
to receive FIB updates as before.

   The format of the messages exchanged with the FPM is defined by the
file 'fpm/fpm.h' in the quagga tree.

   The zebra FPM interface uses replace semantics.  That is, if a 'route
add' message for a prefix is followed by another 'route add' message,
the information in the second message is complete by itself, and
replaces the information sent in the first message.

   If the connection to the FPM goes down for some reason, zebra sends
the FPM a complete copy of the forwarding table(s) when it reconnects.

5 RIP
*****

RIP - Routing Information Protocol is widely deployed interior gateway
protocol.  RIP was developed in the 1970s at Xerox Labs as part of the
XNS routing protocol.  RIP is a "distance-vector" protocol and is based
on the "Bellman-Ford" algorithms.  As a distance-vector protocol, RIP
router send updates to its neighbors periodically, thus allowing the
convergence to a known topology.  In each update, the distance to any
given network will be broadcasted to its neighboring router.

   'ripd' supports RIP version 2 as described in RFC2453 and RIP version
1 as described in RFC1058.

5.1 Starting and Stopping ripd
==============================

The default configuration file name of 'ripd''s is 'ripd.conf'.  When
invocation 'ripd' searches directory /etc/quagga.  If 'ripd.conf' is not
there next search current directory.

   RIP uses UDP port 520 to send and receive RIP packets.  So the user
must have the capability to bind the port, generally this means that the
user must have superuser privileges.  RIP protocol requires interface
information maintained by 'zebra' daemon.  So running 'zebra' is
mandatory to run 'ripd'.  Thus minimum sequence for running RIP is like
below:

     # zebra -d
     # ripd -d

   Please note that 'zebra' must be invoked before 'ripd'.

   To stop 'ripd'.  Please use 'kill `cat /var/run/ripd.pid`'.  Certain
signals have special meaningss to 'ripd'.

'SIGHUP'
     Reload configuration file 'ripd.conf'.  All configurations are
     reseted.  All routes learned so far are cleared and removed from
     routing table.
'SIGUSR1'
     Rotate 'ripd' logfile.
'SIGINT'
'SIGTERM'
     'ripd' sweeps all installed RIP routes then terminates properly.

   'ripd' invocation options.  Common options that can be specified
(*note Common Invocation Options::).

'-r'
'--retain'
     When the program terminates, retain routes added by 'ripd'.

* RIP netmask::                 


File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP netmask,  Up: Starting and Stopping ripd

5.1.1 RIP netmask
-----------------

The netmask features of 'ripd' support both version 1 and version 2 of
RIP. Version 1 of RIP originally contained no netmask information.  In
RIP version 1, network classes were originally used to determine the
size of the netmask.  Class A networks use 8 bits of mask, Class B
networks use 16 bits of masks, while Class C networks use 24 bits of
mask.  Today, the most widely used method of a network mask is assigned
to the packet on the basis of the interface that received the packet.
Version 2 of RIP supports a variable length subnet mask (VLSM). By
extending the subnet mask, the mask can be divided and reused.  Each
subnet can be used for different purposes such as large to middle size
LANs and WAN links.  Quagga 'ripd' does not support the non-sequential
netmasks that are included in RIP Version 2.

   In a case of similar information with the same prefix and metric, the
old information will be suppressed.  Ripd does not currently support
equal cost multipath routing.


File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP Configuration,  Next: RIP Version Control,  Prev: Starting and Stopping ripd,  Up: RIP

5.2 RIP Configuration
=====================

 -- Command: router rip
     The 'router rip' command is necessary to enable RIP. To disable
     RIP, use the 'no router rip' command.  RIP must be enabled before
     carrying out any of the RIP commands.

 -- Command: no router rip
     Disable RIP.

 -- RIP Command: network NETWORK
 -- RIP Command: no network NETWORK
     Set the RIP enable interface by NETWORK.  The interfaces which have
     addresses matching with NETWORK are enabled.

     This group of commands either enables or disables RIP interfaces
     between certain numbers of a specified network address.  For
     example, if the network for 10.0.0.0/24 is RIP enabled, this would
     result in all the addresses from 10.0.0.0 to 10.0.0.255 being
     enabled for RIP. The 'no network' command will disable RIP for the
     specified network.

 -- RIP Command: network IFNAME
 -- RIP Command: no network IFNAME
     Set a RIP enabled interface by IFNAME.  Both the sending and
     receiving of RIP packets will be enabled on the port specified in
     the 'network ifname' command.  The 'no network ifname' command will
     disable RIP on the specified interface.

 -- RIP Command: neighbor A.B.C.D
 -- RIP Command: no neighbor A.B.C.D
     Specify RIP neighbor.  When a neighbor doesn't understand
     multicast, this command is used to specify neighbors.  In some
     cases, not all routers will be able to understand multicasting,
     where packets are sent to a network or a group of addresses.  In a
     situation where a neighbor cannot process multicast packets, it is
     necessary to establish a direct link between routers.  The neighbor
     command allows the network administrator to specify a router as a
     RIP neighbor.  The 'no neighbor a.b.c.d' command will disable the
     RIP neighbor.

   Below is very simple RIP configuration.  Interface 'eth0' and
interface which address match to '10.0.0.0/8' are RIP enabled.

     !
     router rip
      network 10.0.0.0/8
      network eth0
     !

   Passive interface

 -- RIP command: passive-interface (IFNAME|default)
 -- RIP command: no passive-interface IFNAME
     This command sets the specified interface to passive mode.  On
     passive mode interface, all receiving packets are processed as
     normal and ripd does not send either multicast or unicast RIP
     packets except to RIP neighbors specified with 'neighbor' command.
     The interface may be specified as DEFAULT to make ripd default to
     passive on all interfaces.

     The default is to be passive on all interfaces.

   RIP split-horizon

 -- Interface command: ip split-horizon
 -- Interface command: no ip split-horizon
     Control split-horizon on the interface.  Default is 'ip
     split-horizon'.  If you don't perform split-horizon on the
     interface, please specify 'no ip split-horizon'.


File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP Version Control,  Next: How to Announce RIP route,  Prev: RIP Configuration,  Up: RIP

5.3 RIP Version Control
=======================

RIP can be configured to send either Version 1 or Version 2 packets.
The default is to send RIPv2 while accepting both RIPv1 and RIPv2 (and
replying with packets of the appropriate version for REQUESTS /
triggered updates).  The version to receive and send can be specified
globally, and further overriden on a per-interface basis if needs be for
send and receive seperately (see below).

   It is important to note that RIPv1 can not be authenticated.
Further, if RIPv1 is enabled then RIP will reply to REQUEST packets,
sending the state of its RIP routing table to any remote routers that
ask on demand.  For a more detailed discussion on the security
implications of RIPv1 see *note RIP Authentication::.

 -- RIP Command: version VERSION
     Set RIP version to accept for reads and send.  VERSION can be
     either '1" or '2".

     Disabling RIPv1 by specifying version 2 is STRONGLY encouraged,
     *Note RIP Authentication::.  This may become the default in a
     future release.

     Default: Send Version 2, and accept either version.

 -- RIP Command: no version
     Reset the global version setting back to the default.

 -- Interface command: ip rip send version VERSION
     VERSION can be '1', '2' or '1 2'.

     This interface command overrides the global rip version setting,
     and selects which version of RIP to send packets with, for this
     interface specifically.  Choice of RIP Version 1, RIP Version 2, or
     both versions.  In the latter case, where '1 2' is specified,
     packets will be both broadcast and multicast.

     Default: Send packets according to the global version (version 2)

 -- Interface command: ip rip receive version VERSION
     VERSION can be '1', '2' or '1 2'.

     This interface command overrides the global rip version setting,
     and selects which versions of RIP packets will be accepted on this
     interface.  Choice of RIP Version 1, RIP Version 2, or both.

     Default: Accept packets according to the global setting (both 1 and
     2).


File: quagga.info,  Node: How to Announce RIP route,  Next: Filtering RIP Routes,  Prev: RIP Version Control,  Up: RIP

5.4 How to Announce RIP route
=============================

 -- RIP command: redistribute kernel
 -- RIP command: redistribute kernel metric <0-16>
 -- RIP command: redistribute kernel route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute kernel
     'redistribute kernel' redistributes routing information from kernel
     route entries into the RIP tables.  'no redistribute kernel'
     disables the routes.

 -- RIP command: redistribute static
 -- RIP command: redistribute static metric <0-16>
 -- RIP command: redistribute static route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute static
     'redistribute static' redistributes routing information from static
     route entries into the RIP tables.  'no redistribute static'
     disables the routes.

 -- RIP command: redistribute connected
 -- RIP command: redistribute connected metric <0-16>
 -- RIP command: redistribute connected route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute connected
     Redistribute connected routes into the RIP tables.  'no
     redistribute connected' disables the connected routes in the RIP
     tables.  This command redistribute connected of the interface which
     RIP disabled.  The connected route on RIP enabled interface is
     announced by default.

 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf
 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf metric <0-16>
 -- RIP command: redistribute ospf route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute ospf
     'redistribute ospf' redistributes routing information from ospf
     route entries into the RIP tables.  'no redistribute ospf' disables
     the routes.

 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp
 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp metric <0-16>
 -- RIP command: redistribute bgp route-map ROUTE-MAP
 -- RIP command: no redistribute bgp
     'redistribute bgp' redistributes routing information from bgp route
     entries into the RIP tables.  'no redistribute bgp' disables the
     routes.

   If you want to specify RIP only static routes:

 -- RIP command: default-information originate

 -- RIP command: route A.B.C.D/M
 -- RIP command: no route A.B.C.D/M
     This command is specific to Quagga.  The 'route' command makes a
     static route only inside RIP. This command should be used only by
     advanced users who are particularly knowledgeable about the RIP
     protocol.  In most cases, we recommend creating a static route in
     Quagga and redistributing it in RIP using 'redistribute static'.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Filtering RIP Routes,  Next: RIP Metric Manipulation,  Prev: How to Announce RIP route,  Up: RIP

5.5 Filtering RIP Routes
========================

RIP routes can be filtered by a distribute-list.

 -- Command: distribute-list ACCESS_LIST DIRECT IFNAME
     You can apply access lists to the interface with a
     'distribute-list' command.  ACCESS_LIST is the access list name.
     DIRECT is 'in' or 'out'.  If DIRECT is 'in' the access list is
     applied to input packets.

     The 'distribute-list' command can be used to filter the RIP path.
     'distribute-list' can apply access-lists to a chosen interface.
     First, one should specify the access-list.  Next, the name of the
     access-list is used in the distribute-list command.  For example,
     in the following configuration 'eth0' will permit only the paths
     that match the route 10.0.0.0/8

          !
          router rip
           distribute-list private in eth0
          !
          access-list private permit 10 10.0.0.0/8
          access-list private deny any
          !

   'distribute-list' can be applied to both incoming and outgoing data.

 -- Command: distribute-list prefix PREFIX_LIST (in|out) IFNAME
     You can apply prefix lists to the interface with a
     'distribute-list' command.  PREFIX_LIST is the prefix list name.
     Next is the direction of 'in' or 'out'.  If DIRECT is 'in' the
     access list is applied to input packets.


File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP Metric Manipulation,  Next: RIP distance,  Prev: Filtering RIP Routes,  Up: RIP

5.6 RIP Metric Manipulation
===========================

RIP metric is a value for distance for the network.  Usually 'ripd'
increment the metric when the network information is received.
Redistributed routes' metric is set to 1.

 -- RIP command: default-metric <1-16>
 -- RIP command: no default-metric <1-16>
     This command modifies the default metric value for redistributed
     routes.  The default value is 1.  This command does not affect
     connected route even if it is redistributed by 'redistribute
     connected'.  To modify connected route's metric value, please use
     'redistribute connected metric' or 'route-map'.  'offset-list' also
     affects connected routes.

 -- RIP command: offset-list ACCESS-LIST (in|out)
 -- RIP command: offset-list ACCESS-LIST (in|out) IFNAME

5.7 RIP distance
================

Distance value is used in zebra daemon.  Default RIP distance is 120.

 -- RIP command: distance <1-255>
 -- RIP command: no distance <1-255>
     Set default RIP distance to specified value.

 -- RIP command: distance <1-255> A.B.C.D/M
 -- RIP command: no distance <1-255> A.B.C.D/M
     Set default RIP distance to specified value when the route's source
     IP address matches the specified prefix.

 -- RIP command: distance <1-255> A.B.C.D/M ACCESS-LIST
 -- RIP command: no distance <1-255> A.B.C.D/M ACCESS-LIST
     Set default RIP distance to specified value when the route's source
     IP address matches the specified prefix and the specified
     access-list.

5.8 RIP route-map
=================

Usage of 'ripd''s route-map support.

   Optional argument route-map MAP_NAME can be added to each
'redistribute' statement.

     redistribute static [route-map MAP_NAME]
     redistribute connected [route-map MAP_NAME]
     .....

   Cisco applies route-map _before_ routes will exported to rip route
table.  In current Quagga's test implementation, 'ripd' applies
route-map after routes are listed in the route table and before routes
will be announced to an interface (something like output filter).  I
think it is not so clear, but it is draft and it may be changed at
future.

   Route-map statement (*note Route Map::) is needed to use route-map
functionality.

 -- Route Map: match interface WORD
     This command match to incoming interface.  Notation of this match
     is different from Cisco.  Cisco uses a list of interfaces - NAME1
     NAME2 ...  NAMEN. Ripd allows only one name (maybe will change in
     the future).  Next - Cisco means interface which includes next-hop
     of routes (it is somewhat similar to "ip next-hop" statement).
     Ripd means interface where this route will be sent.  This
     difference is because "next-hop" of same routes which sends to
     different interfaces must be different.  Maybe it'd be better to
     made new matches - say "match interface-out NAME" or something like
     that.

 -- Route Map: match ip address WORD
 -- Route Map: match ip address prefix-list WORD
     Match if route destination is permitted by access-list.

 -- Route Map: match ip next-hop WORD
 -- Route Map: match ip next-hop prefix-list WORD
     Match if route next-hop (meaning next-hop listed in the rip
     route-table as displayed by "show ip rip") is permitted by
     access-list.

 -- Route Map: match metric <0-4294967295>
     This command match to the metric value of RIP updates.  For other
     protocol compatibility metric range is shown as <0-4294967295>.
     But for RIP protocol only the value range <0-16> make sense.

 -- Route Map: set ip next-hop A.B.C.D
     This command set next hop value in RIPv2 protocol.  This command
     does not affect RIPv1 because there is no next hop field in the
     packet.

 -- Route Map: set metric <0-4294967295>
     Set a metric for matched route when sending announcement.  The
     metric value range is very large for compatibility with other
     protocols.  For RIP, valid metric values are from 1 to 16.


File: quagga.info,  Node: RIP Authentication,  Next: RIP Timers,  Prev: RIP route-map,  Up: RIP

5.9 RIP Authentication
======================

RIPv2 allows packets to be authenticated via either an insecure plain
text password, included with the packet, or via a more secure MD5 based
HMAC (keyed-Hashing for Message AuthentiCation), RIPv1 can not be
authenticated at all, thus when authentication is configured 'ripd' will
discard routing updates received via RIPv1 packets.

   However, unless RIPv1 reception is disabled entirely, *Note RIP
Version Control::, RIPv1 REQUEST packets which are received, which query
the router for routing information, will still be honoured by 'ripd',
and 'ripd' WILL reply to such packets.  This allows 'ripd' to honour
such REQUESTs (which sometimes is used by old equipment and very simple
devices to bootstrap their default route), while still providing
security for route updates which are received.

   In short: Enabling authentication prevents routes being updated by
unauthenticated remote routers, but still can allow routes (I.e.  the
entire RIP routing table) to be queried remotely, potentially by anyone
on the internet, via RIPv1.

   To prevent such unauthenticated querying of routes disable RIPv1,
*Note RIP Version Control::.

 -- Interface command: ip rip authentication mode md5
 -- Interface command: no ip rip authentication mode md5
     Set the interface with RIPv2 MD5 authentication.

 -- Interface command: ip rip authentication mode text
 -- Interface command: no ip rip authentication mode text
     Set the interface with RIPv2 simple password authentication.

 -- Interface command: ip rip authentication string STRING
 -- Interface command: no ip rip authentication string STRING
     RIP version 2 has simple text authentication.  This command sets
     authentication string.  The string must be shorter than 16
     characters.

 -- Interface command: ip rip authentication key-chain KEY-CHAIN
 -- Interface command: no ip rip authentication key-chain KEY-CHAIN
     Specifiy Keyed MD5 chain.

5.10 RIP Timers
===============

 -- RIP command: timers basic UPDATE TIMEOUT GARBAGE

     RIP protocol has several timers.  User can configure those timers'
     values by 'timers basic' command.

     The default settings for the timers are as follows:

        * The update timer is 30 seconds.  Every update timer seconds,
          the RIP process is awakened to send an unsolicited Response
          message containing the complete routing table to all
          neighboring RIP routers.

        * The timeout timer is 180 seconds.  Upon expiration of the
          timeout, the route is no longer valid; however, it is retained
          in the routing table for a short time so that neighbors can be
          notified that the route has been dropped.

        * The garbage collect timer is 120 seconds.  Upon expiration of
          the garbage-collection timer, the route is finally removed
          from the routing table.

     The 'timers basic' command allows the the default values of the
     timers listed above to be changed.

 -- RIP command: no timers basic
     The 'no timers basic' command will reset the timers to the default
     settings listed above.

=========================

To display RIP routes.

 -- Command: show ip rip

7 OSPFv2
********

OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) version 2 is a routing protocol which is
described in 'RFC2328, OSPF Version 2'.  OSPF is an IGP (Interior
Gateway Protocol).  Compared with RIP, OSPF can provide scalable network
support and faster convergence times.  OSPF is widely used in large
networks such as ISP (Internet Service Provider) backbone and enterprise
networks.

7.1 Configuring ospfd
=====================

There are no 'ospfd' specific options.  Common options can be specified
(*note Common Invocation Options::) to 'ospfd'.  'ospfd' needs to
acquire interface information from 'zebra' in order to function.
Therefore 'zebra' must be running before invoking 'ospfd'.  Also, if
'zebra' is restarted then 'ospfd' must be too.

   Like other daemons, 'ospfd' configuration is done in OSPF specific
configuration file 'ospfd.conf'.


File: quagga.info,  Node: OSPF router,  Next: OSPF area,  Prev: Configuring ospfd,  Up: OSPFv2

7.2 OSPF router
===============

To start OSPF process you have to specify the OSPF router.  As of this
writing, 'ospfd' does not support multiple OSPF processes.

 -- Command: router ospf
 -- Command: no router ospf
     Enable or disable the OSPF process.  'ospfd' does not yet support
     multiple OSPF processes.  So you can not specify an OSPF process
     number.

 -- OSPF Command: ospf router-id A.B.C.D
 -- OSPF Command: no ospf router-id
     This sets the router-ID of the OSPF process.  The router-ID may be
     an IP address of the router, but need not be - it can be any
     arbitrary 32bit number.  However it MUST be unique within the
     entire OSPF domain to the OSPF speaker - bad things will happen if
     multiple OSPF speakers are configured with the same router-ID! If
     one is not specified then 'ospfd' will obtain a router-ID
     automatically from 'zebra'.

 -- OSPF Command: ospf abr-type TYPE
 -- OSPF Command: no ospf abr-type TYPE
     TYPE can be cisco|ibm|shortcut|standard.  The "Cisco" and "IBM"
     types are equivalent.

     The OSPF standard for ABR behaviour does not allow an ABR to
     consider routes through non-backbone areas when its links to the
     backbone are down, even when there are other ABRs in attached
     non-backbone areas which still can reach the backbone - this
     restriction exists primarily to ensure routing-loops are avoided.

     With the "Cisco" or "IBM" ABR type, the default in this release of
     Quagga, this restriction is lifted, allowing an ABR to consider
     summaries learnt from other ABRs through non-backbone areas, and
     hence route via non-backbone areas as a last resort when, and only
     when, backbone links are down.

     Note that areas with fully-adjacent virtual-links are considered to
     be "transit capable" and can always be used to route backbone
     traffic, and hence are unaffected by this setting (*note OSPF
     virtual-link::).

     More information regarding the behaviour controlled by this command
     can be found in 'RFC 3509, Alternative Implementations of OSPF Area
     Border Routers', and 'draft-ietf-ospf-shortcut-abr-02.txt'.

     Quote: "Though the definition of the ABR (Area Border Router) in
     the OSPF specification does not require a router with multiple
     attached areas to have a backbone connection, it is actually
     necessary to provide successful routing to the inter-area and
     external destinations.  If this requirement is not met, all traffic
     destined for the areas not connected to such an ABR or out of the
     OSPF domain, is dropped.  This document describes alternative ABR
     behaviors implemented in Cisco and IBM routers."

 -- OSPF Command: ospf rfc1583compatibility
 -- OSPF Command: no ospf rfc1583compatibility
     'RFC2328', the sucessor to 'RFC1583', suggests according to section
     G.2 (changes) in section 16.4 a change to the path preference
     algorithm that prevents possible routing loops that were possible
     in the old version of OSPFv2.  More specifically it demands that
     inter-area paths and intra-area backbone path are now of equal
     preference but still both preferred to external paths.

     This command should NOT be set normally.

 -- OSPF Command: log-adjacency-changes [detail]
 -- OSPF Command: no log-adjacency-changes [detail]
     Configures ospfd to log changes in adjacency.  With the optional
     detail argument, all changes in adjacency status are shown.
     Without detail, only changes to full or regressions are shown.

 -- OSPF Command: passive-interface INTERFACE
 -- OSPF Command: no passive-interface INTERFACE
     Do not speak OSPF interface on the given interface, but do
     advertise the interface as a stub link in the router-LSA (Link
     State Advertisement) for this router.  This allows one to advertise
     addresses on such connected interfaces without having to originate
     AS-External/Type-5 LSAs (which have global flooding scope) - as
     would occur if connected addresses were redistributed into OSPF
     (*note Redistribute routes to OSPF::).  This is the only way to
     advertise non-OSPF links into stub areas.

 -- OSPF Command: timers throttle spf DELAY INITIAL-HOLDTIME
          MAX-HOLDTIME
 -- OSPF Command: no timers throttle spf
     This command sets the initial DELAY, the INITIAL-HOLDTIME and the
     MAXIMUM-HOLDTIME between when SPF is calculated and the event which
     triggered the calculation.  The times are specified in milliseconds
     and must be in the range of 0 to 600000 milliseconds.

     The DELAY specifies the minimum amount of time to delay SPF
     calculation (hence it affects how long SPF calculation is delayed
     after an event which occurs outside of the holdtime of any previous
     SPF calculation, and also serves as a minimum holdtime).

     Consecutive SPF calculations will always be seperated by at least
     'hold-time' milliseconds.  The hold-time is adaptive and initially
     is set to the INITIAL-HOLDTIME configured with the above command.
     Events which occur within the holdtime of the previous SPF
     calculation will cause the holdtime to be increased by
     INITIAL-HOLDTIME, bounded by the MAXIMUM-HOLDTIME configured with
     this command.  If the adaptive hold-time elapses without any
     SPF-triggering event occuring then the current holdtime is reset to
     the INITIAL-HOLDTIME.  The current holdtime can be viewed with
     *note show ip ospf::, where it is expressed as a multiplier of the
     INITIAL-HOLDTIME.

          router ospf
           timers throttle spf 200 400 10000

     In this example, the DELAY is set to 200ms, the INITIAL HOLDTIME is
     set to 400ms and the MAXIMUM HOLDTIME to 10s.  Hence there will
     always be at least 200ms between an event which requires SPF
     calculation and the actual SPF calculation.  Further consecutive
     SPF calculations will always be seperated by between 400ms to 10s,
     the hold-time increasing by 400ms each time an SPF-triggering event
     occurs within the hold-time of the previous SPF calculation.

     This command supercedes the 'timers spf' command in previous Quagga
     releases.

 -- OSPF Command: max-metric router-lsa [on-startup|on-shutdown]
          <5-86400>
 -- OSPF Command: max-metric router-lsa administrative
 -- OSPF Command: no max-metric router-lsa
          [on-startup|on-shutdown|administrative]
     This enables 'RFC3137, OSPF Stub Router Advertisement' support,
     where the OSPF process describes its transit links in its
     router-LSA as having infinite distance so that other routers will
     avoid calculating transit paths through the router while still
     being able to reach networks through the router.

     This support may be enabled administratively (and indefinitely) or
     conditionally.  Conditional enabling of max-metric router-lsas can
     be for a period of seconds after startup and/or for a period of
     seconds prior to shutdown.

     Enabling this for a period after startup allows OSPF to converge
     fully first without affecting any existing routes used by other
     routers, while still allowing any connected stub links and/or
     redistributed routes to be reachable.  Enabling this for a period
     of time in advance of shutdown allows the router to gracefully
     excuse itself from the OSPF domain.

     Enabling this feature administratively allows for administrative
     intervention for whatever reason, for an indefinite period of time.
     Note that if the configuration is written to file, this
     administrative form of the stub-router command will also be written
     to file.  If 'ospfd' is restarted later, the command will then take
     effect until manually deconfigured.

     Configured state of this feature as well as current status, such as
     the number of second remaining till on-startup or on-shutdown ends,
     can be viewed with the *note show ip ospf:: command.

 -- OSPF Command: auto-cost reference-bandwidth <1-4294967>
 -- OSPF Command: no auto-cost reference-bandwidth
     This sets the reference bandwidth for cost calculations, where this
     bandwidth is considered equivalent to an OSPF cost of 1, specified
     in Mbits/s.  The default is 100Mbit/s (i.e.  a link of bandwidth
     100Mbit/s or higher will have a cost of 1.  Cost of lower bandwidth
     links will be scaled with reference to this cost).

     This configuration setting MUST be consistent across all routers
     within the OSPF domain.

 -- OSPF Command: network A.B.C.D/M area A.B.C.D
 -- OSPF Command: network A.B.C.D/M area <0-4294967295>
 -- OSPF Command: no network A.B.C.D/M area A.B.C.D
 -- OSPF Command: no network A.B.C.D/M area <0-4294967295>
     This command specifies the OSPF enabled interface(s).  If the
     interface has an address from range 192.168.1.0/24 then the command
     below enables ospf on this interface so router can provide network
     information to the other ospf routers via this interface.

          router ospf
           network 192.168.1.0/24 area 0.0.0.0

     Prefix length in interface must be equal or bigger (ie.  smaller
     network) than prefix length in network statement.  For example
     statement above doesn't enable ospf on interface with address
     192.168.1.1/23, but it does on interface with address
     192.168.1.129/25.

     Note that the behavior when there is a peer address defined on an
     interface changed after release 0.99.7.  Currently, if a peer
     prefix has been configured, then we test whether the prefix in the
     network command contains the destination prefix.  Otherwise, we
     test whether the network command prefix contains the local address
     prefix of the interface.

     Summarize intra area paths from specified area into one Type-3
     summary-LSA announced to other areas.  This command can be used
     only in ABR and ONLY router-LSAs (Type-1) and network-LSAs (Type-2)
     (ie.  LSAs with scope area) can be summarized.  Type-5
     AS-external-LSAs can't be summarized - their scope is AS.
     Summarizing Type-7 AS-external-LSAs isn't supported yet by Quagga.

          router ospf
           network 192.168.1.0/24 area 0.0.0.0
           network 10.0.0.0/8 area 0.0.0.10
           area 0.0.0.10 range 10.0.0.0/8

     With configuration above one Type-3 Summary-LSA with routing info
     10.0.0.0/8 is announced into backbone area if area 0.0.0.10
     contains at least one intra-area network (ie.  described with
     router or network LSA) from this range.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D range IPV4_PREFIX not-advertise
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D range IPV4_PREFIX not-advertise
     Instead of summarizing intra area paths filter them - ie.  intra
     area paths from this range are not advertised into other areas.
     This command makes sense in ABR only.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D range IPV4_PREFIX substitute IPV4_PREFIX
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D range IPV4_PREFIX substitute
          IPV4_PREFIX
     Substitute summarized prefix with another prefix.

          router ospf

           area 0.0.0.10 range 10.0.0.0/8 substitute 11.0.0.0/8

     One Type-3 summary-LSA with routing info 11.0.0.0/8 is announced
     into backbone area if area 0.0.0.10 contains at least one
     intra-area network (ie.  described with router-LSA or network-LSA)
     from range 10.0.0.0/8.  This command makes sense in ABR only.

 -- OSPF Command: area <0-4294967295> shortcut
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D shortcut
 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> shortcut
     Configure the area as Shortcut capable.  See 'RFC3509'.  This
     requires that the 'abr-type' be set to 'shortcut'.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D stub
 -- OSPF Command: area <0-4294967295> stub
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D stub
 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> stub
     Configure the area to be a stub area.  That is, an area where no
     router originates routes external to OSPF and hence an area where
     all external routes are via the ABR(s).  Hence, ABRs for such an
     area do not need to pass AS-External LSAs (type-5s) or ASBR-Summary
     LSAs (type-4) into the area.  They need only pass Network-Summary
     (type-3) LSAs into such an area, along with a default-route
     summary.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D stub no-summary
 -- OSPF Command: area <0-4294967295> stub no-summary
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D stub no-summary
 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> stub no-summary
     Prevents an 'ospfd' ABR from injecting inter-area summaries into
     the specified stub area.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D default-cost <0-16777215>
 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D default-cost <0-16777215>

     Filter Type-3 summary-LSAs announced to other areas originated from
     intra- area paths from specified area.

          router ospf

          !
          access-list foo permit 10.10.0.0/16
          access-list foo deny any

     With example above any intra-area paths from area 0.0.0.10 and from
     range 10.10.0.0/16 (for example 10.10.1.0/24 and 10.10.2.128/30)
     are announced into other areas as Type-3 summary-LSA's, but any
     others (for example 10.11.0.0/16 or 10.128.30.16/30) aren't.

     This command is only relevant if the router is an ABR for the
     specified area.

 -- OSPF Command: no area A.B.C.D import-list NAME
 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> import-list NAME
     Same as export-list, but it applies to paths announced into
     specified area as Type-3 summary-LSAs.

 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D filter-list prefix NAME in
 -- OSPF Command: area A.B.C.D filter-list prefix NAME out
 -- OSPF Command: area <0-4294967295> filter-list prefix NAME in

 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> filter-list prefix NAME in
 -- OSPF Command: no area <0-4294967295> filter-list prefix NAME out
     Filtering Type-3 summary-LSAs to/from area using prefix lists.
     This command makes sense in ABR only.

7.4 OSPF interface
==================

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf authentication-key AUTH_KEY
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf authentication-key
     Set OSPF authentication key to a simple password.  After setting
     AUTH_KEY, all OSPF packets are authenticated.  AUTH_KEY has length
     up to 8 chars.

     Simple text password authentication is insecure and deprecated in
     favour of MD5 HMAC authentication (*note ip ospf authentication
     message-digest::).

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf authentication message-digest
     Specify that MD5 HMAC authentication must be used on this
     interface.  MD5 keying material must also be configured (*note ip
     ospf message-digest-key::).  Overrides any authentication enabled
     on a per-area basis (*note area authentication message-digest::).

     Note that OSPF MD5 authentication requires that time never go
     backwards (correct time is NOT important, only that it never goes
     backwards), even across resets, if ospfd is to be able to promptly
     reestabish adjacencies with its neighbours after restarts/reboots.
     The host should have system time be set at boot from an external or
     non-volatile source (eg battery backed clock, NTP, etc.)  or else
     the system clock should be periodically saved to non-volative
     storage and restored at boot if MD5 authentication is to be
     expected to work reliably.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf message-digest-key KEYID md5 KEY
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf message-digest-key
     Set OSPF authentication key to a cryptographic password.  The
     cryptographic algorithm is MD5.

     KEYID identifies secret key used to create the message digest.
     This ID is part of the protocol and must be consistent across
     routers on a link.

     KEY is the actual message digest key, of up to 16 chars (larger
     strings will be truncated), and is associated with the given KEYID.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf cost <1-65535>
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf cost
     Set link cost for the specified interface.  The cost value is set
     to router-LSA's metric field and used for SPF calculation.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf dead-interval <1-65535>
 -- Interface Command: ip ospf dead-interval minimal hello-multiplier
          <2-20>
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf dead-interval
     Set number of seconds for RouterDeadInterval timer value used for
     Wait Timer and Inactivity Timer.  This value must be the same for
     all routers attached to a common network.  The default value is 40
     seconds.

     If 'minimal' is specified instead, then the dead-interval is set to
     1 second and one must specify a hello-multiplier.  The
     hello-multiplier specifies how many Hellos to send per second, from
     2 (every 500ms) to 20 (every 50ms).  Thus one can have 1s
     convergence time for OSPF. If this form is specified, then the
     hello-interval advertised in Hello packets is set to 0 and the
     hello-interval on received Hello packets is not checked, thus the
     hello-multiplier need NOT be the same across multiple routers on a
     common link.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf hello-interval <1-65535>
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf hello-interval
     Set number of seconds for HelloInterval timer value.  Setting this
     value, Hello packet will be sent every timer value seconds on the
     specified interface.  This value must be the same for all routers
     attached to a common network.  The default value is 10 seconds.

     This command has no effect if *note ip ospf dead-interval minimal::
     is also specified for the interface.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf network
          (broadcast|non-broadcast|point-to-multipoint|point-to-point)
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf network
     Set explicitly network type for specifed interface.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf priority <0-255>
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf priority
     Set RouterPriority integer value.  The router with the highest
     priority will be more eligible to become Designated Router.
     Setting the value to 0, makes the router ineligible to become
     Designated Router.  The default value is 1.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf retransmit-interval <1-65535>
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf retransmit interval
     Set number of seconds for RxmtInterval timer value.  This value is
     used when retransmitting Database Description and Link State
     Request packets.  The default value is 5 seconds.

 -- Interface Command: ip ospf transmit-delay
 -- Interface Command: no ip ospf transmit-delay
     Set number of seconds for InfTransDelay value.  LSAs' age should be
     incremented by this value when transmitting.  The default value is
     1 seconds.

File: quagga.info,  Node: OSPF6 router,  Next: OSPF6 area,  Up: OSPFv3

8.1 OSPF6 router
================

 -- Command: router ospf6

 -- OSPF6 Command: router-id A.B.C.D
     Set router's Router-ID.

 -- OSPF6 Command: interface IFNAME area AREA
     Bind interface to specified area, and start sending OSPF packets.
     AREA can be specified as 0.

 -- OSPF6 Command: timers throttle spf DELAY INITIAL-HOLDTIME
          MAX-HOLDTIME
 -- OSPF6 Command: no timers throttle spf
     This command sets the initial DELAY, the INITIAL-HOLDTIME and the
     MAXIMUM-HOLDTIME between when SPF is calculated and the event which
     triggered the calculation.  The times are specified in milliseconds
     and must be in the range of 0 to 600000 milliseconds.

     The DELAY specifies the minimum amount of time to delay SPF
     calculation (hence it affects how long SPF calculation is delayed
     after an event which occurs outside of the holdtime of any previous
     SPF calculation, and also serves as a minimum holdtime).

     Consecutive SPF calculations will always be seperated by at least
     'hold-time' milliseconds.  The hold-time is adaptive and initially
     is set to the INITIAL-HOLDTIME configured with the above command.
     Events which occur within the holdtime of the previous SPF
     calculation will cause the holdtime to be increased by
     INITIAL-HOLDTIME, bounded by the MAXIMUM-HOLDTIME configured with
     this command.  If the adaptive hold-time elapses without any
     SPF-triggering event occuring then the current holdtime is reset to
     the INITIAL-HOLDTIME.

          router ospf6
           timers throttle spf 200 400 10000

     In this example, the DELAY is set to 200ms, the INITIAL HOLDTIME is
     set to 400ms and the MAXIMUM HOLDTIME to 10s.  Hence there will
     always be at least 200ms between an event which requires SPF
     calculation and the actual SPF calculation.  Further consecutive
     SPF calculations will always be seperated by between 400ms to 10s,
     the hold-time increasing by 400ms each time an SPF-triggering event
     occurs within the hold-time of the previous SPF calculation.

 -- OSPF6 Command: auto-cost reference-bandwidth COST
 -- OSPF6 Command: no auto-cost reference-bandwidth
     This sets the reference bandwidth for cost calculations, where this
     bandwidth is considered equivalent to an OSPF cost of 1, specified
     in Mbits/s.  The default is 100Mbit/s (i.e.  a link of bandwidth
     100Mbit/s or higher will have a cost of 1.  Cost of lower bandwidth
     links will be scaled with reference to this cost).

     This configuration setting MUST be consistent across all routers
     within the OSPF domain.

9 Babel
*******

Babel is an interior gateway protocol that is suitable both for wired
networks and for wireless mesh networks.  Babel has been described as
"RIP on speed" -- it is based on the same principles as RIP, but
includes a number of refinements that make it react much faster to
topology changes without ever counting to infinity, and allow it to
perform reliable link quality estimation on wireless links.  Babel is a
double-stack routing protocol, meaning that a single Babel instance is
able to perform routing for both IPv4 and IPv6.

   Quagga implements Babel as described in RFC6126.

9.1 Configuring babeld
======================

The 'babeld' daemon can be invoked with any of the common options (*note
Common Invocation Options::).

   The 'zebra' daemon must be running before 'babeld' is invoked.  Also,
if 'zebra' is restarted then 'babeld' must be too.

   Configuration of 'babeld' is done in its configuration file
'babeld.conf'.


File: quagga.info,  Node: Babel configuration,  Next: Babel redistribution,  Prev: Configuring babeld,  Up: Babel

9.2 Babel configuration
=======================

 -- Command: router babel
 -- Command: no router babel
     Enable or disable Babel routing.

 -- Babel Command: network IFNAME
 -- Babel Command: no network IFNAME
     Enable or disable Babel on the given interface.

 -- Interface Command: babel wired
 -- Interface Command: babel wireless
     Specifies whether this interface is wireless, which disables a
     number of optimisations that are only correct on wired interfaces.
     Specifying 'wireless' (the default) is always correct, but may
     cause slower convergence and extra routing traffic.

 -- Interface Command: babel split-horizon
 -- Interface Command: no babel split-horizon
     Specifies whether to perform split-horizon on the interface.
     Specifying 'no babel split-horizon' (the default) is always
     correct, while 'babel split-horizon' is an optimisation that should
     only be used on symmetric and transitive (wired) networks.

 -- Interface Command: babel hello-interval <20-655340>
     Specifies the time in milliseconds between two scheduled hellos.
     On wired links, Babel notices a link failure within two hello
     intervals; on wireless links, the link quality value is reestimated
     at every hello interval.  The default is 4000ms.

 -- Interface Command: babel update-interval <20-655340>
     Specifies the time in milliseconds between two scheduled updates.
     Since Babel makes extensive use of triggered updates, this can be
     set to fairly high values on links with little packet loss.  The
     default is 20000ms.

 -- Babel Command: babel resend-delay <20-655340>
     Specifies the time in milliseconds after which an "important"
     request or update will be resent.  The default is 2000ms.  You
     probably don't want to tweak this value.

Default configuration file of 'bgpd' is 'bgpd.conf'.  'bgpd' searches
the current directory first then /etc/quagga/bgpd.conf.  All of bgpd's
command must be configured in 'bgpd.conf'.

   'bgpd' specific invocation options are described below.  Common
options may also be specified (*note Common Invocation Options::).

10.2 BGP router
===============

First of all you must configure BGP router with 'router bgp' command.
To configure BGP router, you need AS number.  AS number is an
identification of autonomous system.  BGP protocol uses the AS number
for detecting whether the BGP connection is internal one or external
one.

 -- Command: router bgp ASN
     Enable a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN.  After this
     statement you can input any 'BGP Commands'.  You can not create
     different BGP process under different ASN without specifying
     'multiple-instance' (*note Multiple instance::).

 -- Command: no router bgp ASN
     Destroy a BGP protocol process with the specified ASN.

 -- BGP: bgp router-id A.B.C.D
     This command specifies the router-ID. If 'bgpd' connects to 'zebra'
     it gets interface and address information.  In that case default
     router ID value is selected as the largest IP Address of the
     interfaces.  When 'router zebra' is not enabled 'bgpd' can't get
     interface information so 'router-id' is set to 0.0.0.0.  So please
     set router-id by hand.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER remote-as ASN
     Creates a new neighbor whose remote-as is ASN.  PEER can be an IPv4
     address or an IPv6 address.
          router bgp 1
           neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
     In this case my router, in AS-1, is trying to peer with AS-2 at
     10.0.0.1.

     This command must be the first command used when configuring a
     neighbor.  If the remote-as is not specified, 'bgpd' will complain
     like this:
          can't find neighbor 10.0.0.1

10.4.2 BGP Peer commands
------------------------

In a 'router bgp' clause there are neighbor specific configurations
required.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER shutdown
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER shutdown
     Shutdown the peer.  We can delete the neighbor's configuration by
     'no neighbor PEER remote-as AS-NUMBER' but all configuration of the
     neighbor will be deleted.  When you want to preserve the
     configuration, but want to drop the BGP peer, use this syntax.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER ebgp-multihop
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER ebgp-multihop

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER description ...
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER description ...
     Set description of the peer.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER version VERSION
     Set up the neighbor's BGP version.  VERSION can be 4, 4+ or 4-.
     BGP version 4 is the default value used for BGP peering.  BGP
     version 4+ means that the neighbor supports Multiprotocol
     Extensions for BGP-4.  BGP version 4- is similar but the neighbor
     speaks the old Internet-Draft revision 00's Multiprotocol
     Extensions for BGP-4.  Some routing software is still using this
     version.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER interface IFNAME
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER interface IFNAME
     When you connect to a BGP peer over an IPv6 link-local address, you
     have to specify the IFNAME of the interface used for the
     connection.  To specify IPv4 session addresses, see the 'neighbor
     PEER update-source' command below.

     This command is deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
     Its use should be avoided.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER next-hop-self [all]
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER next-hop-self [all]
     This command specifies an announced route's nexthop as being
     equivalent to the address of the bgp router if it is learned via
     eBGP. If the optional keyword 'all' is specified the modifiation is
     done also for routes learned via iBGP.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER update-source <IFNAME|ADDRESS>
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER update-source
     Specify the IPv4 source address to use for the BGP session to this
     neighbour, may be specified as either an IPv4 address directly or
     as an interface name (in which case the 'zebra' daemon MUST be
     running in order for 'bgpd' to be able to retrieve interface
     state).
          router bgp 64555
           neighbor foo update-source 192.168.0.1
           neighbor bar update-source lo0

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER default-originate
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER default-originate
     'bgpd''s default is to not announce the default route (0.0.0.0/0)
     even it is in routing table.  When you want to announce default
     routes to the peer, use this command.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER port PORT
 -- BGP: neighbor PEER port PORT

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER send-community
 -- BGP: neighbor PEER send-community

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER weight WEIGHT
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER weight WEIGHT
     This command specifies a default WEIGHT value for the neighbor's
     routes.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER maximum-prefix NUMBER
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER maximum-prefix NUMBER

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER local-as AS-NUMBER
 -- BGP: neighbor PEER local-as AS-NUMBER no-prepend
 -- BGP: neighbor PEER local-as AS-NUMBER no-prepend replace-as
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER local-as
     Specify an alternate AS for this BGP process when interacting with
     the specified peer.  With no modifiers, the specified local-as is
     prepended to the received AS_PATH when receiving routing updates
     from the peer, and prepended to the outgoing AS_PATH (after the
     process local AS) when transmitting local routes to the peer.

     If the no-prepend attribute is specified, then the supplied
     local-as is not prepended to the received AS_PATH.

     If the replace-as attribute is specified, then only the supplied
     local-as is prepended to the AS_PATH when transmitting local-route
     updates to this peer.

     Note that replace-as can only be specified if no-prepend is.

     This command is only allowed for eBGP peers.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER ttl-security hops NUMBER
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER ttl-security hops NUMBER
     This command enforces Generalized TTL Security Mechanism (GTSM), as
     specified in RFC 5082.  With this command, only neighbors that are
     the specified number of hops away will be allowed to become
     neighbors.  This command is mututally exclusive with

======================

The AS (Autonomous System) number is one of the essential element of
BGP. BGP is a distance vector routing protocol, and the AS-Path
framework provides distance vector metric and loop detection to BGP.
'RFC1930, Guidelines for creation, selection, and registration of an
Autonomous System (AS)' provides some background on the concepts of an
AS.

   The AS number is a two octet value, ranging in value from 1 to 65535.
The AS numbers 64512 through 65535 are defined as private AS numbers.
Private AS numbers must not to be advertised in the global Internet.

10.7.1 AS Path Regular Expression
---------------------------------

AS path regular expression can be used for displaying BGP routes and AS
path access list.  AS path regular expression is based on 'POSIX 1003.2'
regular expressions.  Following description is just a subset of 'POSIX'
regular expression.  User can use full 'POSIX' regular expression.
Adding to that special character '_' is added for AS path regular
expression.

'.'
     Matches any single character.
'*'
     Matches 0 or more occurrences of pattern.
'+'
     Matches 1 or more occurrences of pattern.
'?'
     Match 0 or 1 occurrences of pattern.
'^'
     Matches the beginning of the line.
'$'
     Matches the end of the line.
'_'
     Character '_' has special meanings in AS path regular expression.
     It matches to space and comma , and AS set delimiter { and } and AS
     confederation delimiter '(' and ')'.  And it also matches to the
     beginning of the line and the end of the line.  So '_' can be used
     for AS value boundaries match.  'show ip bgp regexp _7675_' matches
     to all of BGP routes which as AS number include 7675.

10.8 BGP Communities Attribute
==============================

BGP communities attribute is widely used for implementing policy
routing.  Network operators can manipulate BGP communities attribute
based on their network policy.  BGP communities attribute is defined in
'RFC1997, BGP Communities Attribute' and 'RFC1998, An Application of the
BGP Community Attribute in Multi-home Routing'.  It is an optional
transitive attribute, therefore local policy can travel through
different autonomous system.

   Communities attribute is a set of communities values.  Each
communities value is 4 octet long.  The following format is used to
define communities value.

'AS:VAL'
     This format represents 4 octet communities value.  'AS' is high
     order 2 octet in digit format.  'VAL' is low order 2 octet in digit
     format.  This format is useful to define AS oriented policy value.
     For example, '7675:80' can be used when AS 7675 wants to pass local
     policy value 80 to neighboring peer.
'internet'
     'internet' represents well-known communities value 0.
'no-export'
     'no-export' represents well-known communities value 'NO_EXPORT'
     (0xFFFFFF01).  All routes carry this value must not be advertised
     to outside a BGP confederation boundary.  If neighboring BGP peer
     is part of BGP confederation, the peer is considered as inside a
     BGP confederation boundary, so the route will be announced to the
     peer.
'no-advertise'
     'no-advertise' represents well-known communities value
     'NO_ADVERTISE'
     (0xFFFFFF02).  All routes carry this value must not be advertise to
     other BGP peers.
'local-AS'
     'local-AS' represents well-known communities value
     'NO_EXPORT_SUBCONFED' (0xFFFFFF03).  All routes carry this value
     must not be advertised to external BGP peers.  Even if the
     neighboring router is part of confederation, it is considered as
     external BGP peer, so the route will not be announced to the peer.

   When BGP communities attribute is received, duplicated communities
value in the communities attribute is ignored and each communities
values are sorted in numerical order.

10.8.1 BGP Community Lists
--------------------------

BGP community list is a user defined BGP communites attribute list.  BGP
community list can be used for matching or manipulating BGP communities
attribute in updates.

   There are two types of community list.  One is standard community
list and another is expanded community list.  Standard community list
defines communities attribute.  Expanded community list defines
communities attribute string with regular expression.  Standard
community list is compiled into binary format when user define it.
Standard community list will be directly compared to BGP communities
attribute in BGP updates.  Therefore the comparison is faster than
expanded community list.

 -- Command: ip community-list standard NAME {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new standard community list.  COMMUNITY is
     communities value.  The COMMUNITY is compiled into community
     structure.  We can define multiple community list under same name.
     In that case match will happen user defined order.  Once the
     community list matches to communities attribute in BGP updates it
     return permit or deny by the community list definition.  When there
     is no matched entry, deny will be returned.  When COMMUNITY is
     empty it matches to any routes.

 -- Command: ip community-list expanded NAME {permit|deny} LINE
     This command defines a new expanded community list.  LINE is a
     string expression of communities attribute.  LINE can include
     regular expression to match communities attribute in BGP updates.

 -- Command: no ip community-list NAME
 -- Command: no ip community-list standard NAME
 -- Command: no ip community-list expanded NAME
     These commands delete community lists specified by NAME.  All of
     community lists shares a single name space.  So community lists can
     be removed simpley specifying community lists name.

 -- Command: show ip community-list
 -- Command: show ip community-list NAME
     This command display current community list information.  When NAME
     is specified the specified community list's information is shown.

          # show ip community-list
          Named Community standard list CLIST
              permit 7675:80 7675:100 no-export
              deny internet
          Named Community expanded list EXPAND
              permit :

          # show ip community-list CLIST
          Named Community standard list CLIST
              permit 7675:80 7675:100 no-export

10.8.2 Numbered BGP Community Lists
-----------------------------------

When number is used for BGP community list name, the number has special
meanings.  Community list number in the range from 1 and 99 is standard
community list.  Community list number in the range from 100 to 199 is
expanded community list.  These community lists are called as numbered
community lists.  On the other hand normal community lists is called as
named community lists.

 -- Command: ip community-list <1-99> {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new community list.  <1-99> is standard
     community list number.  Community list name within this range
     defines standard community list.  When COMMUNITY is empty it
     matches to any routes.

 -- Command: ip community-list <100-199> {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     This command defines a new community list.  <100-199> is expanded
     community list number.  Community list name within this range
     defines expanded community list.

 -- Command: ip community-list NAME {permit|deny} COMMUNITY
     When community list type is not specifed, the community list type
     is automatically detected.  If COMMUNITY can be compiled into
     communities attribute, the community list is defined as a standard
     community list.  Otherwise it is defined as an expanded community
     list.  This feature is left for backward compability.  Use of this
     feature is not recommended.

10.8.3 BGP Community in Route Map
---------------------------------

In Route Map (*note Route Map::), we can match or set BGP communities
attribute.  Using this feature network operator can implement their
network policy based on BGP communities attribute.

   Following commands can be used in Route Map.

 -- Route Map: match community WORD
 -- Route Map: match community WORD exact-match
     This command perform match to BGP updates using community list
     WORD.  When the one of BGP communities value match to the one of
     communities value in community list, it is match.  When
     'exact-match' keyword is spcified, match happen only when BGP
     updates have completely same communities value specified in the
     community list.

 -- Route Map: set community none
 -- Route Map: set community COMMUNITY
 -- Route Map: set community COMMUNITY additive
     This command manipulate communities value in BGP updates.  When
     'none' is specified as communities value, it removes entire
     communities attribute from BGP updates.  When COMMUNITY is not
     'none', specified communities value is set to BGP updates.  If BGP
     updates already has BGP communities value, the existing BGP
     communities value is replaced with specified COMMUNITY value.  When
     'additive' keyword is specified, COMMUNITY is appended to the
     existing communities value.

 -- Route Map: set comm-list WORD delete
     This command remove communities value from BGP communities
     attribute.  The WORD is community list name.  When BGP route's
     communities value matches to the community list WORD, the
     communities value is removed.  When all of communities value is
     removed eventually, the BGP update's communities attribute is
     completely removed.

be used for 'show ip bgp' command.

 -- Command: show ip bgp community
 -- Command: show ip bgp community COMMUNITY
 -- Command: show ip bgp community COMMUNITY exact-match
     'show ip bgp community' displays BGP routes which has communities
     attribute.  When COMMUNITY is specified, BGP routes that matches
     COMMUNITY value is displayed.  For this command, 'internet' keyword
     can't be used for COMMUNITY value.  When 'exact-match' is
     specified, it display only routes that have an exact match.

 -- Command: show ip bgp community-list WORD
 -- Command: show ip bgp community-list WORD exact-match
     This commands display BGP routes that matches community list WORD.
     When 'exact-match' is specified, display only routes that have an
     exact match.

      set local-preference 80
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 30
      match community 90
      set local-preference 90

   Following configuration announce 10.0.0.0/8 from AS 100 to AS 7675.
The route has communities value 7675:80 so when above configuration
exists in AS 7675, announced route's local preference will be set to
value 80.

     router bgp 100
      network 10.0.0.0/8
      neighbor 192.168.0.2 remote-as 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.2 route-map RMAP out
     !
     ip prefix-list PLIST permit 10.0.0.0/8
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      match ip address prefix-list PLIST
      set community 7675:80

   Following configuration is an example of BGP route filtering using
communities attribute.  This configuration only permit BGP routes which
has BGP communities value 0:80 or 0:90.  Network operator can put
special internal communities value at BGP border router, then limit the
BGP routes announcement into the internal network.

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list 1 permit 0:80 0:90
     !
     route-map RMAP permit in
      match community 1

   Following exmaple filter BGP routes which has communities value 1:1.
When there is no match community-list returns deny.  To avoid filtering
all of routes, we need to define permit any at last.

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list standard FILTER deny 1:1
     ip community-list standard FILTER permit
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      match community FILTER

   Communities value keyword 'internet' has special meanings in standard
community lists.  In below example 'internet' act as match any.  It
matches all of BGP routes even if the route does not have communities
attribute at all.  So community list 'INTERNET' is same as above
example's 'FILTER'.

     ip community-list standard INTERNET deny 1:1
     ip community-list standard INTERNET permit internet

   Following configuration is an example of communities value deletion.
With this configuration communities value 100:1 and 100:2 is removed
from BGP updates.  For communities value deletion, only 'permit'
community-list is used.  'deny' community-list is ignored.

     router bgp 7675
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 remote-as 100
      neighbor 192.168.0.1 route-map RMAP in
     !
     ip community-list standard DEL permit 100:1 100:2
     !
     route-map RMAP permit 10
      set comm-list DEL delete

10.9 BGP Extended Communities Attribute
=======================================

BGP extended communities attribute is introduced with MPLS VPN/BGP
technology.  MPLS VPN/BGP expands capability of network infrastructure
to provide VPN functionality.  At the same time it requires a new
framework for policy routing.  With BGP Extended Communities Attribute
we can use Route Target or Site of Origin for implementing network
policy for MPLS VPN/BGP.

   BGP Extended Communities Attribute is similar to BGP Communities
Attribute.  It is an optional transitive attribute.  BGP Extended
Communities Attribute can carry multiple Extended Community value.  Each
Extended Community value is eight octet length.

   BGP Extended Communities Attribute provides an extended range
compared with BGP Communities Attribute.  Adding to that there is a type
field in each value to provides community space structure.

   There are two format to define Extended Community value.  One is AS
based format the other is IP address based format.

'AS:VAL'
     This is a format to define AS based Extended Community value.  'AS'
     part is 2 octets Global Administrator subfield in Extended
     Community value.  'VAL' part is 4 octets Local Administrator
     subfield.  '7675:100' represents AS 7675 policy value 100.
'IP-Address:VAL'
     This is a format to define IP address based Extended Community
     value.  'IP-Address' part is 4 octets Global Administrator
     subfield.  'VAL' part is 2 octets Local Administrator subfield.
     '10.0.0.1:100' represents

10.9.1 BGP Extended Community Lists
-----------------------------------

Expanded Community Lists is a user defined BGP Expanded Community Lists.

 -- Command: ip extcommunity-list standard NAME {permit|deny}
          EXTCOMMUNITY
     This command defines a new standard extcommunity-list.
     EXTCOMMUNITY is extended communities value.  The EXTCOMMUNITY is
     compiled into extended community structure.  We can define multiple
     extcommunity-list under same name.  In that case match will happen
     user defined order.  Once the extcommunity-list matches to extended
     communities attribute in BGP updates it return permit or deny based
     upon the extcommunity-list definition.  When there is no matched
     entry, deny will be returned.  When EXTCOMMUNITY is empty it
     matches to any routes.

 -- Command: ip extcommunity-list expanded NAME {permit|deny} LINE
     This command defines a new expanded extcommunity-list.  LINE is a
     string expression of extended communities attribute.  LINE can
     include regular expression to match extended communities attribute
     in BGP updates.

 -- Command: no ip extcommunity-list NAME
 -- Command: no ip extcommunity-list standard NAME
 -- Command: no ip extcommunity-list expanded NAME
     These commands delete extended community lists specified by NAME.
     All of extended community lists shares a single name space.  So
     extended community lists can be removed simpley specifying the
     name.

 -- Command: show ip extcommunity-list
 -- Command: show ip extcommunity-list NAME
     This command display current extcommunity-list information.  When
     NAME is specified the community list's information is shown.

10.11 Capability Negotiation
============================

When adding IPv6 routing information exchange feature to BGP. There were
some proposals.  IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force) IDR (Inter
Domain Routing) WG (Working group) adopted a proposal called
Multiprotocol Extension for BGP. The specification is described in
'RFC2283'.  The protocol does not define new protocols.  It defines new
attributes to existing BGP. When it is used exchanging IPv6 routing
information it is called BGP-4+.  When it is used for exchanging
multicast routing information it is called MBGP.

   'bgpd' supports Multiprotocol Extension for BGP. So if remote peer
supports the protocol, 'bgpd' can exchange IPv6 and/or multicast routing
information.

   Traditional BGP did not have the feature to detect remote peer's
capabilities, e.g.  whether it can handle prefix types other than IPv4
unicast routes.  This was a big problem using Multiprotocol Extension
for BGP to operational network.  'RFC2842, Capabilities Advertisement
with BGP-4' adopted a feature called Capability Negotiation.  'bgpd' use
this Capability Negotiation to detect the remote peer's capabilities.
If the peer is only configured as IPv4 unicast neighbor, 'bgpd' does not
send these Capability Negotiation packets (at least not unless other
optional BGP features require capability negotation).

   By default, Quagga will bring up peering with minimal common
capability for the both sides.  For example, local router has unicast
and multicast capabilitie and remote router has unicast capability.  In
this case, the local router will establish the connection with unicast
only capability.  When there are no common capabilities, Quagga sends
Unsupported Capability error and then resets the connection.

   If you want to completely match capabilities with remote peer.
Please use 'strict-capability-match' command.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER strict-capability-match
     Strictly compares remote capabilities and local capabilities.  If
     capabilities are different, send Unsupported Capability error then
     reset connection.

   You may want to disable sending Capability Negotiation OPEN message
optional parameter to the peer when remote peer does not implement
Capability Negotiation.  Please use 'dont-capability-negotiate' command
to disable the feature.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER dont-capability-negotiate
     Suppress sending Capability Negotiation as OPEN message optional
     parameter to the peer.  This command only affects the peer is
     configured other than IPv4 unicast configuration.

   When remote peer does not have capability negotiation feature, remote
peer will not send any capabilities at all.  In that case, bgp
configures the peer with configured capabilities.

   You may prefer locally configured capabilities more than the
negotiated capabilities even though remote peer sends capabilities.  If
the peer is configured by 'override-capability', 'bgpd' ignores received
capabilities then override negotiated capabilities with configured
values.

 -- BGP: neighbor PEER override-capability
 -- BGP: no neighbor PEER override-capability
     Override the result of Capability Negotiation with local
     configuration.  Ignore remote peer's capability value.

10.13 Route Server
==================

At an Internet Exchange point, many ISPs are connected to each other by
external BGP peering.  Normally these external BGP connection are done
by 'full mesh' method.  As with internal BGP full mesh formation, this
method has a scaling problem.

   This scaling problem is well known.  Route Server is a method to
resolve the problem.  Each ISP's BGP router only peers to Route Server.
Route Server serves as BGP information exchange to other BGP routers.
By applying this method, numbers of BGP connections is reduced from
O(n*(n-1)/2) to O(n).

   Unlike normal BGP router, Route Server must have several routing
tables for managing different routing policies for each BGP speaker.  We
call the routing tables as different 'view's.  'bgpd' can work as normal
BGP router or Route Server or both at the same time.

File: quagga.info,  Node: Multiple instance,  Next: BGP instance and view,  Up: Route Server

10.13.1 Multiple instance
-------------------------

To enable multiple view function of 'bgpd', you must turn on multiple
instance feature beforehand.

 -- Command: bgp multiple-instance
     Enable BGP multiple instance feature.  After this feature is
     enabled, you can make multiple BGP instances or multiple BGP views.

 -- Command: no bgp multiple-instance
     Disable BGP multiple instance feature.  You can not disable this
     feature when BGP multiple instances or views exist.

   When you want to make configuration more Cisco like one,

 -- Command: bgp config-type cisco
     Cisco compatible BGP configuration output.

   When bgp config-type cisco is specified,

   "no synchronization" is displayed.  "no auto-summary" is displayed.

   "network" and "aggregate-address" argument is displayed as "A.B.C.D
M.M.M.M"

   Quagga: network 10.0.0.0/8 Cisco: network 10.0.0.0

   Quagga: aggregate-address 192.168.0.0/24 Cisco: aggregate-address
192.168.0.0 255.255.255.0

   Community attribute handling is also different.  If there is no
configuration is specified community attribute and extended community
attribute are sent to neighbor.  When user manually disable the feature
community attribute is not sent to the neighbor.  In case of 'bgp
config-type cisco' is specified, community attribute is not sent to the
neighbor by default.  To send community attribute user has to specify
'neighbor A.B.C.D send-community' command.

10.13.2 BGP instance and view
-----------------------------

BGP instance is a normal BGP process.  The result of route selection
goes to the kernel routing table.  You can setup different AS at the
same time when BGP multiple instance feature is enabled.

 -- Command: router bgp AS-NUMBER
     Make a new BGP instance.  You can use arbitrary word for the NAME.

     bgp multiple-instance
     !
     router bgp 1
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 3
     !
     router bgp 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 4
      neighbor 10.0.0.4 remote-as 5

   BGP view is almost same as normal BGP process.  The result of route
selection does not go to the kernel routing table.  BGP view is only for
exchanging BGP routing information.

 -- Command: router bgp AS-NUMBER view NAME
     Make a new BGP view.  You can use arbitrary word for the NAME.
     This view's route selection result does not go to the kernel
     routing table.

   With this command, you can setup Route Server like below.

     bgp multiple-instance
     !
     router bgp 1 view 1
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 3
     !
     router bgp 2 view 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.3 remote-as 4
      neighbor 10.0.0.4 remote-as 5


File: quagga.info,  Node: Routing policy,  Next: Viewing the view,  Prev: BGP instance and view,  Up: Route Server

10.13.3 Routing policy
----------------------

You can set different routing policy for a peer.  For example, you can
set different filter for a peer.

     bgp multiple-instance
     !
     router bgp 1 view 1
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 distribute-list 1 in
     !
     router bgp 1 view 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 remote-as 2
      neighbor 10.0.0.1 distribute-list 2 in

   This means BGP update from a peer 10.0.0.1 goes to both BGP view 1
and view 2.  When the update is inserted into view 1, distribute-list 1
is applied.  On the other hand, when the update is inserted into view 2,
distribute-list 2 is applied.

for customer routes based on community values.  Extensive use of
route-maps and the 'call' feature to support selective advertising of
prefixes.  This example is intended as guidance only, it has NOT been

11 Configuring Quagga as a Route Server
***************************************

The purpose of a Route Server is to centralize the peerings between BGP
speakers.  For example if we have an exchange point scenario with four
BGP speakers, each of which maintaining a BGP peering with the other
three (*note Figure 11.2: fig:full-mesh.), we can convert it into a
centralized scenario where each of the four establishes a single BGP
peering against the Route Server (*note Figure 11.3: fig:route-server.).

   We will first describe briefly the Route Server model implemented by
Quagga.  We will explain the commands that have been added for
configuring that model.  And finally we will show a full example of
Quagga configured as Route Server.

11.1 Description of the Route Server model
==========================================

First we are going to describe the normal processing that BGP
announcements suffer inside a standard BGP speaker, as shown in *note
Figure 11.1: fig:normal-processing, it consists of three steps:

   * When an announcement is received from some peer, the 'In' filters
     configured for that peer are applied to the announcement.  These
     filters can reject the announcement, accept it unmodified, or
     accept it with some of its attributes modified.

   * The announcements that pass the 'In' filters go into the Best Path
     Selection process, where they are compared to other announcements
     referred to the same destination that have been received from
     different peers (in case such other announcements exist).  For each
     different destination, the announcement which is selected as the
     best is inserted into the BGP speaker's Loc-RIB.

   * The routes which are inserted in the Loc-RIB are considered for
     announcement to all the peers (except the one from which the route
     came).  This is done by passing the routes in the Loc-RIB through
     the 'Out' filters corresponding to each peer.  These filters can
     reject the route, accept it unmodified, or accept it with some of
     its attributes modified.  Those routes which are accepted by the
     'Out' filters of a peer are announced to that peer.

Figure 11.3: Route Server and clients

   Of course we want that the routing tables obtained in each of the
routers are the same when using the route server than when not.  But as
a consequence of having a single BGP peering (against the route server),
the BGP speakers can no longer distinguish from/to which peer each
announce comes/goes.  This means that the routers connected to the route
server are not able to apply by themselves the same input/output filters
as in the full mesh scenario, so they have to delegate those functions
to the route server.

   Even more, the "best path" selection must be also performed inside
the route server on behalf of its clients.  The reason is that if, after
applying the filters of the announcer and the (potential) receiver, the
route server decides to send to some client two or more different
announcements referred to the same destination, the client will only
retain the last one, considering it as an implicit withdrawal of the
previous announcements for the same destination.  This is the expected
behavior of a BGP speaker as defined in 'RFC1771', and even though there
are some proposals of mechanisms that permit multiple paths for the same
destination to be sent through a single BGP peering, none are currently
supported by most existing BGP implementations.

   As a consequence a route server must maintain additional information
and perform additional tasks for a RS-client that those necessary for
common BGP peerings.  Essentially a route server must:

   * Maintain a separated Routing Information Base (Loc-RIB) for each
     peer configured as RS-client, containing the routes selected as a
     result of the "Best Path Selection" process that is performed on
     behalf of that RS-client.

   * Whenever it receives an announcement from a RS-client, it must
     consider it for the Loc-RIBs of the other RS-clients.

        * This means that for each of them the route server must pass
          the announcement through the appropriate 'Out' filter of the
          announcer.

        * Then through the appropriate 'In' filter of the potential
          receiver.

        * Only if the announcement is accepted by both filters it will
          be passed to the "Best Path Selection" process.

        * Finally, it might go into the Loc-RIB of the receiver.

   When we talk about the "appropriate" filter, both the announcer and
the receiver of the route must be taken into account.  Suppose that the
route server receives an announcement from client A, and the route
server is considering it for the Loc-RIB of client B. The filters that
should be applied are the same that would be used in the full mesh
scenario, i.e., first the 'Out' filter of router A for announcements
going to router B, and then the 'In' filter of router B for
announcements coming from router A.

   We call "Export Policy" of a RS-client to the set of 'Out' filters
that the client would use if there was no route server.  The same
applies for the "Import Policy" of a RS-client and the set of 'In'
filters of the client if there was no route server.

   It is also common to demand from a route server that it does not
modify some BGP attributes (next-hop, as-path and MED) that are usually
modified by standard BGP speakers before announcing a route.

   The announcement processing model implemented by Quagga is shown in
*note Figure 11.4: fig:rs-processing.  The figure shows a mixture of
RS-clients (B, C and D) with normal BGP peers (A). There are some
details that worth additional comments:

   * Announcements coming from a normal BGP peer are also considered for
     the Loc-RIBs of all the RS-clients.  But logically they do not pass
     through any export policy.

   * Those peers that are configured as RS-clients do not receive any
     announce from the 'Main' Loc-RIB.

   * Apart from import and export policies, 'In' and 'Out' filters can
     also be set for RS-clients.  'In' filters might be useful when the
     route server has also normal BGP peers.  On the other hand, 'Out'
     filters for RS-clients are probably unnecessary, but we decided not
     to remove them as they do not hurt anybody (they can always be left
     empty).

11.2 Commands for configuring a Route Server
============================================

Now we will describe the commands that have been added to quagga in
order to support the route server features.

 -- Route-Server: neighbor PEER-GROUP route-server-client
 -- Route-Server: neighbor A.B.C.D route-server-client
 -- Route-Server: neighbor X:X::X:X route-server-client
     This command configures the peer given by PEER, A.B.C.D or X:X::X:X
     as an RS-client.

     Actually this command is not new, it already existed in standard
     Quagga.  It enables the transparent mode for the specified peer.
     This means that some BGP attributes (as-path, next-hop and MED) of
     the routes announced to that peer are not modified.

     With the route server patch, this command, apart from setting the
     transparent mode, creates a new Loc-RIB dedicated to the specified
     peer (those named 'Loc-RIB for X' in *note Figure 11.4:
     fig:rs-processing.).  Starting from that moment, every announcement
     received by the route server will be also considered for the new
     Loc-RIB.

 -- Route-Server: neigbor {A.B.C.D|X.X::X.X|peer-group} route-map WORD
          {import|export}
     This set of commands can be used to specify the route-map that
     represents the Import or Export policy of a peer which is
     configured as a RS-client (with the previous command).

 -- Route-Server: match peer {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X}
     This is a new _match_ statement for use in route-maps, enabling
     them to describe import/export policies.  As we said before, an
     import/export policy represents a set of input/output filters of
     the RS-client.  This statement makes possible that a single
     route-map represents the full set of filters that a BGP speaker
     would use for its different peers in a non-RS scenario.

     The _match peer_ statement has different semantics whether it is
     used inside an import or an export route-map.  In the first case
     the statement matches if the address of the peer who sends the
     announce is the same that the address specified by
     {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X}.  For export route-maps it matches when
     {A.B.C.D|X:X::X:X} is the address of the RS-Client into whose
     Loc-RIB the announce is going to be inserted (how the same export
     policy is applied before different Loc-RIBs is shown in *note
     Figure 11.4: fig:rs-processing.).

 -- Route-map Command: call WORD
     This command (also used inside a route-map) jumps into a different
     route-map, whose name is specified by WORD.  When the called
     route-map finishes, depending on its result the original route-map
     continues or not.  Apart from being useful for making import/export
     route-maps easier to write, this command can also be used inside
     any normal (in or out) route-map.

11.3 Example of Route Server Configuration
==========================================

Finally we are going to show how to configure a Quagga daemon to act as
a Route Server.  For this purpose we are going to present a scenario
without route server, and then we will show how to use the
configurations of the BGP routers to generate the configuration of the
route server.

   All the configuration files shown in this section have been taken
from scenarios which were tested using the VNUML tool VNUML
(http://www.dit.upm.es/vnuml).

11.3.1 Configuration of the BGP routers without Route Server
------------------------------------------------------------

We will suppose that our initial scenario is an exchange point with
three BGP capable routers, named RA, RB and RC. Each of the BGP speakers
generates some routes (with the NETWORK command), and establishes BGP
peerings against the other two routers.  These peerings have In and Out
route-maps configured, named like "PEER-X-IN" or "PEER-X-OUT". For
example the configuration file for router RA could be the following:

     #Configuration for router 'RA'

     password ****
     !

11.3.2 Configuration of the BGP routers with Route Server
---------------------------------------------------------

To convert the initial scenario into one with route server, first we
must modify the configuration of routers RA, RB and RC. Now they must
not peer between them, but only with the route server.  For example,
RA's configuration would turn into:

     # Configuration for router 'RA'
     !
     hostname RA
     password ****
     !
     router bgp 65001
       no bgp default ipv4-unicast
       neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF remote-as 65000
     !
       address-family ipv6
         network 2001:0DB8:AAAA:1::/64
         network 2001:0DB8:AAAA:2::/64
         network 2001:0DB8:0000:1::/64
         network 2001:0DB8:0000:2::/64

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF activate
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::FFFF soft-reconfiguration inbound
       exit-address-family
     !
     line vty
     !

   Which is logically much simpler than its initial configuration, as it
now maintains only one BGP peering and all the filters (route-maps) have
disappeared.

11.3.3 Configuration of the Route Server itself
-----------------------------------------------

As we said when we described the functions of a route server (*note
Description of the Route Server model::), it is in charge of all the
route filtering.  To achieve that, the In and Out filters from the RA,
RB and RC configurations must be converted into Import and Export
policies in the route server.

   This is a fragment of the route server configuration (we only show
the policies for client RA):

     # Configuration for Route Server ('RS')
     !
     hostname RS
     password ix
     !
     bgp multiple-instance
     !
     router bgp 65000 view RS
       no bgp default ipv4-unicast
       neighbor 2001:0DB8::A  remote-as 65001
       neighbor 2001:0DB8::B  remote-as 65002

       match ipv6 address prefix-list PEER-A-PREFIXES
     !
     ...
     ...
     ...

   If you compare the initial configuration of RA with the route server
configuration above, you can see how easy it is to generate the Import
and Export policies for RA from the In and Out route-maps of RA's
original configuration.

   When there was no route server, RA maintained two peerings, one with
RB and another with RC. Each of this peerings had an In route-map
configured.  To build the Import route-map for client RA in the route
server, simply add route-map entries following this scheme:

     route-map <NAME> permit 10
         match peer <Peer Address>
         call <In Route-Map for this Peer>
     route-map <NAME> permit 20
         match peer <Another Peer Address>
         call <In Route-Map for this Peer>

   This is exactly the process that has been followed to generate the
route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT. The route-maps that are called inside it
(A-IMPORT-FROM-B and A-IMPORT-FROM-C) are exactly the same than the In
route-maps from the original configuration of RA (PEER-B-IN and
PEER-C-IN), only the name is different.

   The same could have been done to create the Export policy for RA
(route-map RSCLIENT-A-EXPORT), but in this case the original Out
route-maps where so simple that we decided not to use the CALL WORD
commands, and we integrated all in a single route-map
(RSCLIENT-A-EXPORT).

   The Import and Export policies for RB and RC are not shown, but the
process would be identical.

11.3.4 Further considerations about Import and Export route-maps
----------------------------------------------------------------

The current version of the route server patch only allows to specify a
route-map for import and export policies, while in a standard BGP
speaker apart from route-maps there are other tools for performing input
and output filtering (access-lists, community-lists, ...).  But this
does not represent any limitation, as all kinds of filters can be
included in import/export route-maps.  For example suppose that in the
non-route-server scenario peer RA had the following filters configured
for input from peer B:

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B prefix-list LIST-1 in
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B filter-list LIST-2 in
         neighbor 2001:0DB8::B route-map PEER-B-IN in
         ...
         ...
     route-map PEER-B-IN permit 10
       match ipv6 address prefix-list COMMON-PREFIXES
       set local-preference 100
     route-map PEER-B-IN permit 20
       match ipv6 address prefix-list PEER-B-PREFIXES
       set community 65001:11111

   It is posible to write a single route-map which is equivalent to the
three filters (the community-list, the prefix-list and the route-map).
That route-map can then be used inside the Import policy in the route
server.  Lets see how to do it:

         neighbor 2001:0DB8::A route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT import
         ...
     !
     ...
     route-map RSCLIENT-A-IMPORT permit 10
       match peer 2001:0DB8::B
       call A-IMPORT-FROM-B
     ...
     ...
     !
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 1
       match ipv6 address prefix-list LIST-1
       match as-path LIST-2
       on-match goto 10
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B deny 2
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 10
       match ipv6 address prefix-list COMMON-PREFIXES
       set local-preference 100
     route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B permit 20
       match ipv6 address prefix-list PEER-B-PREFIXES
       set community 65001:11111
     !
     ...
     ...

   The route-map A-IMPORT-FROM-B is equivalent to the three filters
(LIST-1, LIST-2 and PEER-B-IN). The first entry of route-map
A-IMPORT-FROM-B (sequence number 1) matches if and only if both the
prefix-list LIST-1 and the filter-list LIST-2 match.  If that happens,
due to the "on-match goto 10" statement the next route-map entry to be
processed will be number 10, and as of that point route-map
A-IMPORT-FROM-B is identical to PEER-B-IN. If the first entry does not
match, 'on-match goto 10" will be ignored and the next processed entry
will be number 2, which will deny the route.

   Thus, the result is the same that with the three original filters,
i.e., if either LIST-1 or LIST-2 rejects the route, it does not reach
the route-map PEER-B-IN. In case both LIST-1 and LIST-2 accept the
route, it passes to PEER-B-IN, which can reject, accept or modify the
route.

************

'vtysh' is integrated shell of Quagga software.

   To use vtysh please specify --enable-vtysh to configure script.  To
use PAM for authentication use --with-libpam option to configure script.

   vtysh only searches /etc/quagga path for vtysh.conf which is the
vtysh configuration file.  Vtysh does not search current directory for
configuration file because the file includes user authentication
settings.

   Currently, vtysh.conf has only two commands.

=======================

 -- Command: username USERNAME nopassword

     With this set, user foo does not need password authentication for
     user vtysh.  With PAM vtysh uses PAM authentication mechanism.

     If vtysh is compiled without PAM authentication, every user can use
     vtysh without authentication.  vtysh requires read/write permission
     to the various daemons vty sockets, this can be accomplished
     through use of unix groups and the -enable-vty-group configure
     option.

12.2 VTY shell integrated configuration
=======================================

 -- Command: service integrated-vtysh-config
     Write out integrated Quagga.conf file when 'write file' is issued.

     This command controls the behaviour of vtysh when it is told to
     write out the configuration.  Per default, vtysh will instruct each
     daemon to write out their own config files when 'write file' is
     issued.  However, if 'service integrated-vtysh-config' is set, when
     'write file' is issued, vtysh will instruct the daemons will write
     out a Quagga.conf with all daemons' commands integrated into it.

     Vtysh per default behaves as if 'write-conf daemon' is set.  Note
     that both may be set at same time if one wishes to have both
     Quagga.conf and daemon specific files written out.  Further, note
     that the daemons are hard-coded to first look for the integrated
     Quagga.conf file before looking for their own file.

     We recommend you do not mix the use of the two types of files.
     Further, it is better not to use the integrated Quagga.conf file,
     as any syntax error in it can lead to /all/ of your daemons being
     unable to start up.  Per daemon files are more robust as impact of
     errors in configuration are limited to the daemon in whose file the
     error is made.

13 Filtering
************

Quagga provides many very flexible filtering features.  Filtering is
used for both input and output of the routing information.  Once
filtering is defined, it can be applied in any direction.

* IP Access List::              
* IP Prefix List::              


File: quagga.info,  Node: IP Access List,  Next: IP Prefix List,  Up: Filtering

13.1 IP Access List
===================

 -- Command: access-list NAME permit IPV4-NETWORK
 -- Command: access-list NAME deny IPV4-NETWORK

   Basic filtering is done by 'access-list' as shown in the following
example.

     access-list filter deny 10.0.0.0/9
     access-list filter permit 10.0.0.0/8


File: quagga.info,  Node: IP Prefix List,  Prev: IP Access List,  Up: Filtering

13.2 IP Prefix List
===================

'ip prefix-list' provides the most powerful prefix based filtering
mechanism.  In addition to 'access-list' functionality, 'ip prefix-list'
has prefix length range specification and sequential number
specification.  You can add or delete prefix based filters to arbitrary
points of prefix-list using sequential number specification.

   If no ip prefix-list is specified, it acts as permit.  If 'ip
prefix-list' is defined, and no match is found, default deny is applied.

 -- Command: ip prefix-list NAME (permit|deny) PREFIX [le LEN] [ge LEN]
 -- Command: ip prefix-list NAME seq NUMBER (permit|deny) PREFIX [le
          LEN] [ge LEN]

     You can create 'ip prefix-list' using above commands.

     seq
          seq NUMBER can be set either automatically or manually.  In
          the case that sequential numbers are set manually, the user
          may pick any number less than 4294967295.  In the case that
          sequential number are set automatically, the sequential number
          will increase by a unit of five (5) per list.  If a list with
          no specified sequential number is created after a list with a
          specified sequential number, the list will automatically pick
          the next multiple of five (5) as the list number.  For
          example, if a list with number 2 already exists and a new list
          with no specified number is created, the next list will be
          numbered 5.  If lists 2 and 7 already exist and a new list
          with no specified number is created, the new list will be
          numbered 10.

     le
          'le' command specifies prefix length.  The prefix list will be
          applied if the prefix length is less than or equal to the le
          prefix length.

     ge
          'ge' command specifies prefix length.  The prefix list will be
          applied if the prefix length is greater than or equal to the
          ge prefix length.

   Less than or equal to prefix numbers and greater than or equal to
prefix numbers can be used together.  The order of the le and ge
commands does not matter.

   If a prefix list with a different sequential number but with the
exact same rules as a previous list is created, an error will result.
However, in the case that the sequential number and the rules are
exactly similar, no error will result.

   If a list with the same sequential number as a previous list is
created, the new list will overwrite the old list.

   Matching of IP Prefix is performed from the smaller sequential number
to the larger.  The matching will stop once any rule has been applied.

   In the case of no le or ge command, the prefix length must match
exactly the length specified in the prefix list.

14 Route Map
************

Route maps provide a means to both filter and/or apply actions to route,
hence allowing policy to be applied to routes.

* Menu:

* Route Map Command::           
* Route Map Match Command::     
* Route Map Set Command::
* Route Map Call Command::
* Route Map Exit Action Command::
* Route Map Examples::

   Route-maps are an ordered list of route-map entries.  Each entry may
specify up to four distincts sets of clauses:

'Matching Policy'

     This specifies the policy implied if the 'Matching Conditions' are
     met or not met, and which actions of the route-map are to be taken,
     if any.  The two possibilities are:

        - 'permit': If the entry matches, then carry out the 'Set
          Actions'.  Then finish processing the route-map, permitting
          the route, unless an 'Exit Action' indicates otherwise.

        - 'deny': If the entry matches, then finish processing the
          route-map and deny the route (return 'deny').

     The 'Matching Policy' is specified as part of the command which
     defines the ordered entry in the route-map.  See below.

'Matching Conditions'

     A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more conditions
     which must be matched if the entry is to be considered further, as
     governed by the Match Policy.  If a route-map entry does not
     explicitely specify any matching conditions, then it always
     matches.

'Set Actions'

     A route-map entry may, optionally, specify one or more 'Set
     Actions' to set or modify attributes of the route.

'Call Action'

     Call to another route-map, after any 'Set Actions' have been
     carried out.  If the route-map called returns 'deny' then
     processing of the route-map finishes and the route is denied,
     regardless of the 'Matching Policy' or the 'Exit Policy'.  If the
     called route-map returns 'permit', then 'Matching Policy' and 'Exit
     Policy' govern further behaviour, as normal.

'Exit Policy'

     An entry may, optionally, specify an alternative 'Exit Policy' to
     take if the entry matched, rather than the normal policy of exiting
     the route-map and permitting the route.  The two possibilities are:

        - 'next': Continue on with processing of the route-map entries.

        - 'goto N': Jump ahead to the first route-map entry whose order
          in the route-map is >= N. Jumping to a previous entry is not
          permitted.

   The default action of a route-map, if no entries match, is to deny.
I.e.  a route-map essentially has as its last entry an empty 'deny'
entry, which matches all routes.  To change this behaviour, one must
specify an empty 'permit' entry as the last entry in the route-map.

   To summarise the above:

         Match    No Match
-----------------------------
_Permit_ action   cont
_Deny_   deny     cont

'action'
        - Apply _set_ statements

        - If _call_ is present, call given route-map.  If that returns a
          'deny', finish processing and return 'deny'.

        - If 'Exit Policy' is _next_, goto next route-map entry

        - If 'Exit Policy' is _goto_, goto first entry whose order in
          the list is >= the given order.

        - Finish processing the route-map and permit the route.

'deny'
        - The route is denied by the route-map (return 'deny').

'cont'
        - goto next route-map entry

15 IPv6 Support
***************

Quagga fully supports IPv6 routing.  As described so far, Quagga
supports RIPng, OSPFv3, Babel and BGP-4+.  You can give IPv6 addresses
to an interface and configure static IPv6 routing information.  Quagga
IPv6 also provides automatic address configuration via a feature called
'address auto configuration'.  To do it, the router must send router
advertisement messages to the all nodes that exist on the network.

* Menu:

* Router Advertisement::        


File: quagga.info,  Node: Router Advertisement,  Up: IPv6 Support

          [router-address]
     Configuring the IPv6 prefix to include in router advertisements.
     Several prefix specific optional parameters and flags may follow:
        * VALID-LIFETIME - the length of time in seconds during what the
          prefix is valid for the purpose of on-link determination.
          Value INFINITE represents infinity (i.e.  a value of all one
          bits ('0xffffffff')).

          Range: '<0-4294967295>' Default: '2592000'

        * PREFERRED-LIFETIME - the length of time in seconds during what
          addresses generated from the prefix remain preferred.  Value
          INFINITE represents infinity.

          Range: '<0-4294967295>' Default: '604800'

        * OFF-LINK - indicates that advertisement makes no statement
          about on-link or off-link properties of the prefix.

          Default: not set, i.e.  this prefix can be used for on-link
          determination.

        * NO-AUTOCONFIG - indicates to hosts on the local link that the
          specified prefix cannot be used for IPv6 autoconfiguration.

          Default: not set, i.e.  prefix can be used for
          autoconfiguration.

16 Kernel Interface
*******************

There are several different methods for reading kernel routing table
information, updating kernel routing tables, and for looking up
interfaces.

'ioctl'
     The 'ioctl' method is a very traditional way for reading or writing
     kernel information.  'ioctl' can be used for looking up interfaces
     and for modifying interface addresses, flags, mtu settings and
     other types of information.  Also, 'ioctl' can insert and delete
     kernel routing table entries.  It will soon be available on almost
     any platform which zebra supports, but it is a little bit ugly thus
     far, so if a better method is supported by the kernel, zebra will
     use that.

'sysctl'
     'sysctl' can lookup kernel information using MIB (Management
     Information Base) syntax.  Normally, it only provides a way of
     getting information from the kernel.  So one would usually want to
     change kernel information using another method such as 'ioctl'.

'proc filesystem'
     'proc filesystem' provides an easy way of getting kernel
     information.

'routing socket'

'netlink'
     On recent Linux kernels (2.0.x and 2.2.x), there is a kernel/user
     communication support called 'netlink'.  It makes asynchronous
     communication between kernel and Quagga possible, similar to a
     routing socket on BSD systems.

     Before you use this feature, be sure to select (in kernel
     configuration) the kernel/netlink support option 'Kernel/User
     network link driver' and 'Routing messages'.

     Today, the /dev/route special device file is obsolete.  Netlink
     communication is done by reading/writing over netlink socket.

     After the kernel configuration, please reconfigure and rebuild
     Quagga.  You can use netlink as a dynamic routing update channel
     between Quagga and the kernel.

17 SNMP Support
***************

SNMP (Simple Network Managing Protocol) is a widely implemented feature
for collecting network information from router and/or host.  Quagga
itself does not support SNMP agent (server daemon) functionality but is
able to connect to a SNMP agent using the SMUX protocol ('RFC1227') or
the AgentX protocol ('RFC2741') and make the routing protocol MIBs
available through it.

* Menu:

* Getting and installing an SNMP agent::
* AgentX configuration::
* SMUX configuration::
* MIB and command reference::
* Handling SNMP Traps::


File: quagga.info,  Node: Getting and installing an SNMP agent,  Next: AgentX configuration,  Up: SNMP Support

17.1 Getting and installing an SNMP agent
=========================================

There are several SNMP agent which support SMUX or AgentX. We recommend
to use the latest version of 'net-snmp' which was formerly known as
'ucd-snmp'.  It is free and open software and available at
<http://www.net-snmp.org/> and as binary package for most Linux
distributions.  'net-snmp' has to be compiled with
'--with-mib-modules=agentx' to be able to accept connections from Quagga
using AgentX protocol or with '--with-mib-modules=smux' to use SMUX
protocol.

   Nowadays, SMUX is a legacy protocol.  The AgentX protocol should be
preferred for any new deployment.  Both protocols have the same
coverage.


File: quagga.info,  Node: AgentX configuration,  Next: SMUX configuration,  Prev: Getting and installing an SNMP agent,  Up: SNMP Support

17.2 AgentX configuration
=========================

To enable AgentX protocol support, Quagga must have been build with the
'--enable-snmp' or '--enable-snmp=agentx' option.  Both the master SNMP
agent (snmpd) and each of the Quagga daemons must be configured.  In
'/etc/snmp/snmpd.conf', 'master agentx' directive should be added.  In
each of the Quagga daemons, 'agentx' command will enable AgentX support.

     /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:
     	#
     	# example access restrictions setup
     	#
     	com2sec readonly default public
     	group MyROGroup v1 readonly
     	view all included .1 80
     	access MyROGroup "" any noauth exact all none none
     	#
     	# enable master agent for AgentX subagents
     	#
     	master agentx

     /etc/quagga/ospfd.conf:
     	! ... the rest of ospfd.conf has been omitted for clarity ...
     	!
     	agentx
     	!

   Upon successful connection, you should get something like this in the
log of each Quagga daemons:

     2012/05/25 11:39:08 ZEBRA: snmp[info]: NET-SNMP version 5.4.3 AgentX subagent connected

   Then, you can use the following command to check everything works as
expected:

     # snmpwalk -c public -v1 localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.1
     OSPF-MIB::ospfRouterId.0 = IpAddress: 192.168.42.109
     [...]

   The AgentX protocol can be transported over a Unix socket or using
TCP or UDP. It usually defaults to a Unix socket and depends on how
NetSNMP was built.  If need to configure Quagga to use another
transport, you can configure it through '/etc/snmp/quagga.conf':

     /etc/snmp/quagga.conf:
     	[snmpd]
     	# Use a remote master agent
     	agentXSocket tcp:192.168.15.12:705


File: quagga.info,  Node: SMUX configuration,  Next: MIB and command reference,  Prev: AgentX configuration,  Up: SNMP Support

17.3 SMUX configuration
=======================

To enable SMUX protocol support, Quagga must have been build with the
'--enable-snmp=smux' option.

   A separate connection has then to be established between the SNMP
agent (snmpd) and each of the Quagga daemons.  This connections each use
different OID numbers and passwords.  Be aware that this OID number is
not the one that is used in queries by clients, it is solely used for
the intercommunication of the daemons.

   In the following example the ospfd daemon will be connected to the
snmpd daemon using the password "quagga_ospfd".  For testing it is
recommending to take exactly the below snmpd.conf as wrong access
restrictions can be hard to debug.

     /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf:
     	#
     	# example access restrictions setup
     	#
     	com2sec readonly default public
     	group MyROGroup v1 readonly
     	view all included .1 80
     	access MyROGroup "" any noauth exact all none none
     	#
     	# the following line is relevant for Quagga
     	#
     	smuxpeer .1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.5 quagga_ospfd

     /etc/quagga/ospf:
     	! ... the rest of ospfd.conf has been omitted for clarity ...
     	!
     	smux peer .1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.5 quagga_ospfd
     	!

   After restarting snmpd and quagga, a successful connection can be
verified in the syslog and by querying the SNMP daemon:

     snmpd[12300]: [smux_accept] accepted fd 12 from 127.0.0.1:36255
     snmpd[12300]: accepted smux peer: \
     	oid GNOME-PRODUCT-ZEBRA-MIB::ospfd, quagga-0.96.5

     # snmpwalk -c public -v1 localhost .1.3.6.1.2.1.14.1.1
     OSPF-MIB::ospfRouterId.0 = IpAddress: 192.168.42.109

   Be warned that the current version (5.1.1) of the Net-SNMP daemon
writes a line for every SNMP connect to the syslog which can lead to
enormous log file sizes.  If that is a problem you should consider to
patch snmpd and comment out the troublesome 'snmp_log()' line in the
function 'netsnmp_agent_check_packet()' in 'agent/snmp_agent.c'.


File: quagga.info,  Node: MIB and command reference,  Next: Handling SNMP Traps,  Prev: SMUX configuration,  Up: SNMP Support

17.4 MIB and command reference
==============================

The following OID numbers are used for the interprocess communication of
snmpd and the Quagga daemons with SMUX only.
                 (OIDs below .iso.org.dod.internet.private.enterprises)
     zebra	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.1 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.zserv
     bgpd	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.2 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.bgpd
     ripd	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.3 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.ripd
     ospfd	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.5 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.ospfd
     ospf6d	.1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.6 .gnome.gnomeProducts.zebra.ospf6d

   Sadly, SNMP has not been implemented in all daemons yet.  The
following OID numbers are used for querying the SNMP daemon by a client:
     zebra	.1.3.6.1.2.1.4.24   .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipForward
     ospfd	.1.3.6.1.2.1.14	    .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ospf
     bgpd	.1.3.6.1.2.1.15	    .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.bgp
     ripd	.1.3.6.1.2.1.23	    .iso.org.dot.internet.mgmt.mib-2.rip2
     ospf6d	.1.3.6.1.3.102	    .iso.org.dod.internet.experimental.ospfv3

   The following syntax is understood by the Quagga daemons for
configuring SNMP using SMUX:
 -- Command: smux peer OID
 -- Command: no smux peer OID

 -- Command: smux peer OID PASSWORD
 -- Command: no smux peer OID PASSWORD

   Here is the syntax for using AgentX:
 -- Command: agentx
 -- Command: no agentx


File: quagga.info,  Node: Handling SNMP Traps,  Prev: MIB and command reference,  Up: SNMP Support

17.5 Handling SNMP Traps
========================

To handle snmp traps make sure your snmp setup of quagga works correctly
as described in the quagga documentation in *Note SNMP Support::.

   The BGP4 mib will send traps on peer up/down events.  These should be
visible in your snmp logs with a message similar to:

   'snmpd[13733]: Got trap from peer on fd 14'

   To react on these traps they should be handled by a trapsink.
Configure your trapsink by adding the following lines to
'/etc/snmpd/snmpd.conf':

       # send traps to the snmptrapd on localhost
       trapsink localhost

   This will send all traps to an snmptrapd running on localhost.  You
can of course also use a dedicated management station to catch traps.
Configure the snmptrapd daemon by adding the following line to
'/etc/snmpd/snmptrapd.conf':

       traphandle .1.3.6.1.4.1.3317.1.2.2 /etc/snmp/snmptrap_handle.sh

   This will use the bash script '/etc/snmp/snmptrap_handle.sh' to
handle the BGP4 traps.  To add traps for other protocol daemons, lookup
their appropriate OID from their mib.  (For additional information about
which traps are supported by your mib, lookup the mib on
<http://www.oidview.com/mibs/detail.html>).

   Make sure snmptrapd is started.

   The snmptrap_handle.sh script I personally use for handling BGP4
traps is below.  You can of course do all sorts of things when handling
traps, like sound a siren, have your display flash, etc., be creative
;).

Appendix A Zebra Protocol
*************************

A.1 Overview of the Zebra Protocol
==================================

Zebra Protocol is used by protocol daemons to communicate with the zebra
daemon.

   Each protocol daemon may request and send information to and from the
zebra daemon such as interface states, routing state,
nexthop-validation, and so on.  Protocol daemons may also install routes
with zebra.  The zebra daemon manages which route is installed into the
forwarding table with the kernel.

   Zebra Protocol is a streaming protocol, with a common header.  Two
versions of the header are in use.  Version 0 is implicitely versioned.
Version 1 has an explicit version field.  Version 0 can be distinguished
from all other versions by examining the 3rd byte of the header, which
contains a marker value for all versions bar version 0.  The marker byte
corresponds to the command field in version 0, and the marker value is a
reserved command in version 0.

   We do not anticipate there will be further versions of the header for
the foreseeable future, as the command field in version 1 is wide enough
to allow for future extensions to done compatibly through seperate
commands.

   Version 0 is used by all versions of GNU Zebra as of this writing,
and versions of Quagga up to and including Quagga 0.98.  Version 1 will
be used as of Quagga 1.0.

     +-------------------------------+

A.2.3 Zebra Protocol Header Field Definitions
---------------------------------------------

'Length'
     Total packet length including this header.  The minimum length is 3
     bytes for version 0 messages and 6 bytes for version 1 messages.

'Marker'
     Static marker with a value of 255 always.  This is to allow version
     0 Zserv headers (which do not include version explicitely) to be
     distinguished from versioned headers.  Not present in version 0
     messages.

'Version'
     Version number of the Zserv message.  Clients should not continue
     processing messages past the version field for versions they do not
     recognise.  Not present in version 0 messages.

'Command'
     The Zebra Protocol command.

A.2.4 Zebra Protocol Commands
-----------------------------

Command                                      Value

Appendix B Packet Binary Dump Format
************************************

Quagga can dump routing protocol packet into file with a binary format
(*note Dump BGP packets and table::).

   It seems to be better that we share the MRT's header format for
backward compatibility with MRT's dump logs.  We should also define the
binary format excluding the header, because we must support both IP v4
and v6 addresses as socket addresses and / or routing entries.

   In the last meeting, we discussed to have a version field in the
header.  But Masaki told us that we can define new 'type' value rather
than having a 'version' field, and it seems to be better because we
don't need to change header format.

   Here is the common header format.  This is same as that of MRT.
