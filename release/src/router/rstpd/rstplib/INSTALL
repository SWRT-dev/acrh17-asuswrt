Basic Installation
==================

While there is no a special configure process, the simplest way to
compile this package is:

1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
   `make'. There may problems in compiling on another platforms.

2. After that the packege is ready to usage. You will get 3 libraies
   (libcli.a  librstp.a  libuid.a) and 2 executables: mngr & bridge

In the future 'configure' file will be designed for another
platfors.
