The Rapid Spanning Tree Library project contains a  full  implementation
of 802.1s as an library  with API.  There is two  processes,  using this
library: 'bridge' & 'mngr'. First simulates RSTP bridge behavior, second
is dedicated to link/unlink 'bridges' into virtual RSTP domain (VRSTPD).
Both 'bridge' & 'mngr' has its own simple CLI like language of commands;
these  commands  allow  to manage the VRSTPD.  There are  tools to trace
state machine transitions and get traps about drastic changes.

Purpose: studying, debugging, development.

The library may be used in real bridges/routers while bounding to a real
system depending environment.

To run:
1. In one shell run 'mngr'
./mngr
You will get prompt of 'mngr'; type '?' and get full help of
'mngr' commands.

2. In another shell run bridge instance.
./bridge
You will get prompt of 'bridge'; type '?' and get full help
of bridge management commands.

3. You may (and should) run a number of bridge instances, each in its 
separate shell (this way you will be able manage them).

For example, if there were two bridge instances, you may see examples
of the dialog in files mngr.txt, B5055.txt and B5056.txt.

Note: prompt both of 'mngr' and of 'bridge' instance contains time stamp,
while all these process run onto the same computer, these time stamps
are synchronized.
