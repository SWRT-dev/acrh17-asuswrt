- All per Port variables have been moved from the State
  Machines into the Port instance (it made the state
  machines much more clear)

- In libcli.a instead of stupid fgets() function we use
  now readline (thanks to Michel Roshavsky)

- 'mcheck' support

- 'nonStp' support (I know, that it is out the standard,
  but it seems to be useful (see a discussion on
http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/working-groups/bridge/current/msg00038.html)
  and our customers demand it

- The function rolesel.c has been drastically fixed, IMHO
  closer to the standard

- Nicer output
