Building from source
====================

Linux
-----
Once the source tarball has been untarred move to its top
level directory and issue these commands: 

    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)


If configure.ac, Makefile.am or src/Makefile.am have changed
then ./autogen.sh should be run prior to the above sequence.

A linux rpm spec file called sdparm.spec is included in the main
directory. This spec file expects to find a tarball
called "sdparm-<version_num>.tgz" in the appropriate place.

To build a linux debian "deb" (binary) package, first untar the tarball,
then change directory to the top level within the sdparm source. Then:
 # chmod +x debian/rules
 # dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot
A script file called build_debian.sh in the main directory contains
these lines. The binary deb packages will be placed in the parent
directory (of the sdparm source directory) if all goes well.

FreeBSD
-------
In FreeBSD, the "./configure;make;make install" method should work.

Solaris
-------
In Solaris, the "./configure;make;make install" method should work.
It is assumed gcc is present.

Tru64 (OSF)
-----------
With Tru64 this invocation can be used:
    "./autogen.sh && CC=cc ./configure && gmake"

Windows
-------
On Windows (NT or later) download cygwin plus gcc, makefile
and binutils (if they are not in the minimal cygwin distribution).
Then from within a cygwin (bash) shell issue these commands:
    ./configure
    make
A 'make install' can also be done. The executable is called
sdparm.exe and is in the 'src' subdirectory. It can be executed
in a DOS ("cmd") shell as long as the cygwin1.dll file that it
depends on is placed in an appropriate place.

Alternatively the MinGW/MSYS environment can be used: first
download and install MinGW (the gcc compiler and tools), then
download and install MSYS (bash like shell that supports
automake). From the MSYS shell, in the top level of the sdparm
source issue these commands:
    ./configure
    make
The executable is called sdparm.exe and is in the 'src' subdirectory.
It can be executed in a MSYS or DOS ("cmd") shell.
