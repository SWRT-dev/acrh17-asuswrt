* NOTE *
This file used to contain an overview of the DBUS API for Avahi, however
since it was no longer up to date you should now read the XML-formatted DBUS
Introspection files, which are fairly easy to understand and kept up to date.

You can see them in the avahi-daemon source directory, named *.introspect.

Opening them in a web browser is a good way to view them as they are formatted
nicely, you can also view our online copy under "Developing with Avahi" here:
