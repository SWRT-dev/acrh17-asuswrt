    <description>
      <p><file>@pkgsysconfdir@/hosts</file> is a file which may be used
      to define static host name to IP address mappings for multicast
      DNS. This is especially useful when publishing DNS-SD services
      on behalf of other hosts. See <manref name="avahi.service"
      section="5"/> for more information.</p>

      <p>The file format is similar to the one of
      <file>/etc/hosts</file>: on each line an IP address and the
      corresponding host name. The host names should be in FQDN form,
      i.e. with appended .local suffix.</p>
