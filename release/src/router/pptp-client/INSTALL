Installation Instructions - Brief

    1.  install pppd (with MPPE if you require it),
    2.  if pppd is not in /usr/sbin, edit Makefile, variable PPPD,
    3.  'make'
    4.  'make install'


Installation Instructions - Detailed

    1.  install PPP, and make sure it is working.

        On most distributions, use the package called ppp or pppd.

        If your PPTP server requires MPPE, make sure the pppd program
        has been built with MPPE and MS-CHAP support.  PPP from
        version 2.4.2 onwards has this support.  PPP may require
        kernel support for MPPE, which may require patching your
        kernel.

    2.  verify that the pppd program is in the /usr/sbin/ directory.

        On some distributions, it is in /usr/bin, or somewhere else.
        If it isn't in the default directory, edit the Makefile, and
        change the PPPD variable to point at the pppd program.

        You may even want to run a separate pppd program with MPPE
        support.

    3.  compile

        Type 'make'.  This should generate the 'pptp' executable.

    4.  install binaries

	Type 'make install' to have the program and the manual page
	installed.
