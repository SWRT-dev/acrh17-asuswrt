 Note that items with (!) have high priority.

lscpu
-----
  - detect more hypervisors, see 'virt-what' shell script
    http://people.redhat.com/~rjones/virt-what/

losetup
-------
  - add new option --pretty and --output <columns> to print details about
    one or all (-a) devices by lib/tt.c output. For example people hate
    the hex devno in the default output.

dmesg
-----

 - add --follow option
   http://www.spinics.net/lists/util-linux-ng/msg04453.html

 - add --color to colorize err and panic messages

hwclock
-------

 - (!!!) add "hwclock -c|--compare" to provide info about RTC frequency offset
   like "adjtimex -c", shell version:

	#!/bin/bash
	date > /dev/null
	hwdate=$(hwclock -r)
	time1_sys=$(date +'%s.%N')
	time1_hw=$(date -d "${hwdate% -*}" +'%s')

	while sleep 10; do
	    hwdate=$(hwclock -r)
	    time2_sys=$(date +'%s.%N')
	    time2_hw=$(date -d "${hwdate% -*}" +'%s')
	    awk "END { x = (($time1_hw - $time1_sys) - ($time2_hw - $time2_sys)) /
	($time2_hw - $time1_hw); printf \"sysclock/RTC frequency offset: %.0f ppm (%.0f
	ticks)\n\", x * 1e6, x * 1e4}" < /dev/null
	done

ldattach
--------

  - write usage()

minix (fsck, mkfs)
------------------

 - clean up types -- use ino_t, size_t and ssize_t

libmount (mount/umount)
-----------------------

 Note that the old mount/[u]mount.c code is in MAINTENANCE MODE only. All new
 features should be implemented to libmount or to the new sys-utils/{mount,umount}.c
 utils.

 - add options to control fstab/mtab mount options usage, something like:

   --options-mode={ignore,append,prepend,replace}      MNT_OMODE_{IGNORE, ...}
   --options-source={fstab,mtab,disable}               MNT_OMODE_{FSTAB,MTAB,NOTAB}
   --options-source-force                              MNT_OMODE_FORCE

   (all this already supported by libmount)

 - add x-mount-mkdir mount option to libmount to allow "mkdir /mountpoint"

 - support MS_PROPAGATION flags in fstab -- note that kernel assumes that
   these flags are not mixed with another mount flags, it means that:

	/dev/sda1	/mnt/foo	auto 	ro,shared

   has be implemented by two syscalls:

	mount("/dev/sda1", "/mnt/foo", "ext4", MS_RDONLY, NULL);
	mount(NULL, "/mnt/foo", "none", MS_REMOUNT|MS_SHARED, NULL);

   yeah, there is race ;-(

 - (!) on systems with regular mtab file it is impossible to umount by "umount
   /dev/loop0" if the loop device has been created by "mount -o loop", because
   there is backing file in the mtab (instead of the device name). 

   Now we have all necessary information in /sysfs so it should be possible to
   translate the device name to backing file and then search in mtab for the 
   filename. See loopdev_get_loopfile().

 - (!) add --source and --target options to specify device and mountpoint

     fstab:
        /dev/sda1 /foo	auto	defaults 0 0
        /foo      /mnt  auto    bind     0 0
     command line:
	mount -o remount,ro /foo

    ... this command is ambiguous. It would be better to have a way how specify
    target or source:

        mount --target /foo -o remount,ro

    Note that findmnt(8) already supports --target and --source.

 - add ---target-prefix option to specify prefix for mountpoints
   so then you can

	mount --fstab=/etc/fstab.sandbox -a --target-prefix=/mnt/sandbox

   to create a new hierarchy of filesystems at sandbox

 - umount by label:
	# mount LABEL=mylabel
	# umount LABEL=mylabel


libblkd and libmount
--------------------

 - use __attribute__((notnull)) and __attribute__((warn_unused_result))
   Note that the code has to be usefull for non-gcc compilers too.

partx
-----

 - support mapping by device-mapper if argv[0] is "kpartx" or --dm option is used.
     
 - (!) add regression tests for partx, addpart and delpart


docs
----

 - (!) use something better than gtk-doc for libmount and libblkid (doxyden?)

 - (!) add API documentation to libuuid


build-sys
--------

 - use non-recursive build-sys, see
   http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.utilities.util-linux-ng/3297

lib/tt.c
--------

 - allows to sort columns, for example sort lsblk(8) output by SIZE

login-utils:
-----------

 - use err() and warn() macros rather than fprintf(stderr, ...)
 - (!) merge newgrp from shadow-utils
 - (!) enable login utils by default

libblkid
--------

 - (!) don't use internally blkid_loff_t, rather use off_t, size_t, ssize_t,
       stdint.h types and so on...

 - add -<BE|LE> suffix to test images for native-endian filesystems (e.g. swap)
   and add support for such functionality to tests/ts/blkid/low-probe

 - add FSSIZE value  -- filesystem size (klibc requirement)

 - (!) add support for dasd PT (used for example on s390)

 - (!!!) support PARTUUID= tag

   * the partitions probing is already supported by low-level part of the
     library, but it's necessary add support for this tag also to high-level
     blkid_cache and blkid_evaluate_* APIs

   * add blkid -P <PARTUUID>

   * add PARTUUID to wipefs output

fdisk(s)
--------

 - add to "First sector" dialog a line with information about available
   gaps (free areas) to make it more user friendly if you want to skip
   any useless (small) areas between existing partitions. 
   See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=715114

 - add "move end" command to move end of the last primary/extended partition.
   This feature seems very attractive to users who resizing their disks 
   (for example in virtual machines).

 - sfdisk has to use rpmatch() for answers to y/n questions
   (e.g. "Are you satisfied with this? [ynq]")

 - sfdisk rounds to cylinders is -uM (megabyte units) is specified, this is
   pretty stupid feature. It has to round to sectors if -uS or -uM is specified.

 - Sun label support is completely useless for large disks, it uses number of
   cylinders from on-disk-label where the geometry is stored by int16 values.
   It seems better to completely ignore this stuff from the label and always
   use geometry + BLKGETSIZE64 from kernel.

 - use off_t instead "long long"

 - catch SIGINT (Ctrl-C) and return to main menu.
   From Red Hat bugzilla #545488:

   While using fdisk normally, if you accidentally pressed the wrong button (to
   start a sequence of questions for some operation, e.g. 'c' to create
   partition).  The tool tries too hard to keep asking you for valid input.  You
   can't provide a blank or invalid input to get it to break out of the current
   dialog sequence and get back to the main menu.

 - fdisk/* refactoring (probably implement libfdisk ???)

 - add GPT support (probably implement libfdisk ???)

misc
----

 - switch_root:
     - move all mountpoints to the newroot (there are hardcoded /proc /sys and /dev paths now)
     - add --dont-move[=<list of dirs>] options

 - use TZ=UTC

 - add mllockall() and SCHED_FIFO to hwclock,
   see http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/10/12/132
 
 - use rpmatch() for all Y/N questions

 - (!) rewrite ipcs to use /proc/sys/kernel rather than unreliable syscalls
   (there are problems with 32bit userspace on 64bit kernel)

exotic requests

 - mount -a -- reorder fstab entries by paths before mount (just idea only)

 - mount -a  (just idea only)

        Date:   Sun, 3 Jun 2007 18:04:24 +0300 (MET DST)
        From: Szabolcs Szakacsits <szaka@sienet.hu>

	In the past the right record order could be figured out easily by just
	checking out fstab (if one knew what to look for) but considering the
	fastly increasing number of user space file systems and their usage, with
	their path, library, etc dependencies, it's getting trickier and is a black
	magic for most users because they simply expect drives to be mounted
	independently of their order in fstab.

	One typical, wrongly edited fstab example is:

	  /dev/hda2 /             ext3      defaults  1 1
	  /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows  ntfs-3g   defaults  0 0
	  /dev/hda3 /usr          ext3      defaults  0 0

	The events:

	  mount  ->  /sbin/mount.ntfs-3g  ->
		 ->  resolves to <path1>/ntfs-3g via a symlink ->
		 ->  ntfs-3g requires at least <path2>/libfuse*

	There are many potential solutions. For example installing everything on
	the root file system which may be needed for successful mount. But this
	is not always feasible or practical since we could end up putting almost
	everything on the root file system in the end.

	Another idea is an improved mount strategy:

	  do {
		try to mount all unmounted entries
	  } while (not all mounted && at least one new was successfully mounted)


 - add SELinux security contexts support to the 'ipcs' utility
   http://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=225342

   Would be great to list the current system IPC Objects with their respective
   security labels (where allowed) with something like 'ipcs -Z' - following the
   way other tools reports those.
