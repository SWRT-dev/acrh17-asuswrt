.PP
When in the source a new sentence begins somewhere midline, it should use a
double space before its initial letter.  This is done because groff uses double
spaces last sentence ends to end of line, and next begins from new line.
Unless double spaces are used in middle of of line the spacing style is
inconsistent.
