 util-linux regression tests
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 It's expected that for each invasive change or important bugfix you will
 include a test to your patch.


 Run all tests:

	./run.sh [--verbose]

 Run subset of tests:

	./run.sh <test_directory-name>

        for example:

              ./run.sh blkid
              ./run.sh fdisk



 *** WARNING ***

 The tests touch your /etc/fstab. Please, be careful and use
 these tests only for development and never on production system.
