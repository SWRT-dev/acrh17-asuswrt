Release schedule
----------------

The util-linux uses <major>.<minor>.<maint> version numbering.
Since the major version is pretty much fixed the release means an
upgrade of minor number. Minor version is update roughly twice
per year. Easiest way to estimate when next version will occur is
to see time stamp of previous release.

Before a release there are few release candidates, which will be
collectively tested. During test period changes to code base are
restricted. Usually there are two release candidates.

  what	 lenght		what will be accepted to upstream
  -------------------------------------------------------
  rc1	 1-2 weeks	bug fixes only
  rc2	 1-2 weeks	translations, fatal/trivial bug fixes

The period between a release and next release candidate can be considered as
merge window.

Release criteria
----------------

For all releases is required:

   - make checkincludes pass
   - make checkconfig pass
   - make distcheck pass
   - cd tests && ./run.sh pass
   - out-of-tree build works
     cd .. && mkdir build && cd build && ../util-linux/configure && make

   - ideally: build with uClibc, --with-slang
