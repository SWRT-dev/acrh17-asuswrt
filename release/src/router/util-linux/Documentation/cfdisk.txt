Announcing the new curses based fdisk program... cfdisk

cfdisk is a curses based disk drive partitioning program that can
create partitions for a wide variety of operating systems including
Linux, MS-DOS and OS/2.  cfdisk was inspired by the fdisk program, by
A. V. Le Blanc (LeBlanc@mcc.ac.uk).  I hope that this program will be
useful to both new and old Linux users, and I hope it will make the
installation process easier.


                           **** WARNING ****
If you write a bad partition table to disk, it may destroy data and
partitions.
