.SH NAME
logger \- a shell command interface to the syslog(3) system log module
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B logger
[options] [message]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B logger
makes entries in the system log.  It provides a shell command
interface to the
.BR syslog (3)
system log module.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-udp\fR
Use datagram (UDP) instead of the default stream connection (TCP).
.TP
\fB\-i\fR, \fB\-\-id\fR
Log the process ID of the logger process with each line.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR, \fB\-\-file\fR \fIfile\fR
Log the contents of the specified
.IR file .
This option cannot be combined with a command-line message.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Display a help text and exit.
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-server\fR \fIserver\fR
Write to the specified remote syslog
.I server
using UDP instead of to the builtin syslog routines.
.TP
\fB\-P\fR, \fB\-\-port\fR \fIport\fR
Use the specified UDP
.IR port .
The default port number is 514.
.TP
\fB\-p\fR, \fB\-\-priority\fR \fIpriority\fR
Enter the message into the log with the specified
.IR priority  .
The priority may be specified numerically or as a
.I facility.level
pair.
For example,
.B -p
.I local3.info
logs the message as informational in the local3 facility.
The default is
.IR user.notice .
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-stderr\fR
Output the message to standard error as well as to the system log.
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-tag\fR \fItag\fR
Mark every line to be logged with the specified
.IR tag .
.TP
\fB\-u\fR, \fB\-\-socket\fR \fIsocket\fR
Write to the specified
.I socket
instead of to the builtin syslog routines.
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Display version information and exit.
.TP
\fB\-\-\fR
End the argument list.  This is to allow the
.I message
to start with a hyphen (\-).
.TP
.I message
Write the message to log; if not specified, and the
.I \-f
flag is not provided, standard input is logged.
.PP
The
.B logger
utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
.PP
Valid facility names are:
.IR auth , \ authpriv
(for security information of a sensitive nature),
.IR cron , \ daemon , \ ftp , \ kern
(can't be generated from user process),
.IR lpr , \ mail , \ news , \ security
(deprecated synonym for
.IR auth ), \ syslog , \ user , \ uucp ,
and
.IR local0 \ to \ local7 ,
inclusive.
.PP
Valid level names are:
.IR alert , \ crit , \ debug , \ emerg , \ err , \ error
(deprecated synonym for
.IR err ), \ info , \ notice , \ panic
(deprecated synonym for

.SH STANDARDS
The
.B logger
command is expected to be IEEE Std 1003.2 ("POSIX.2") compatible.
.SH AVAILABILITY
