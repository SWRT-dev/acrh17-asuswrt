.TH LSBLK 8 "April 2010" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
lsblk \- list block devices
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsblk
.RB [ options ]
.sp
.B lsblk
.RB [ options ]
.IR device...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B lsblk
lists information about all or the specified block devices.  The
.B lsblk
command reads the
.I sysfs
filesystem to gather information.
.PP
The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-like format
by default.  Use
.B "lsblk --help"
to get a list of all available columns.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-a, \-\-all\fP"
List all block devices.
.IP "\fB\-b, \-\-bytes\fP"
Print the SIZE column in bytes rather than in human-readable format.
.IP "\fB\-d, \-\-nodeps\fP"
Don't print device holders or slaves.  For example "lsblk --nodeps /dev/sda" prints
information about the sda device only.
.IP "\fB\-D, \-\-discard\fP"
Print information about the discard (TRIM, UNMAP) capabilities for each device.
.IP "\fB\-e, \-\-exclude \fIlist\fP
Exclude the devices specified by a comma-separated \fIlist\fR of major device numbers.
Note that RAM disks (major=1) are excluded by default.
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-fs\fP
Output info about filesystems.  This option is equivalent to "-o NAME,FSTYPE,LABEL,MOUNTPOINT".
The authoritative information about filesystems and raids is provided by the
.BR blkid (8)
command.
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Print a help text and exit.
.IP "\fB\-i, \-\-ascii\fP"
Use ASCII characters for tree formatting.
.IP "\fB\-m, \-\-perms\fP
Output info about device owner, group and mode.  This option is equivalent to "-o NAME,SIZE,OWNER,GROUP,MODE".
.IP "\fB\-l, \-\-list\fP"
Use the list output format.
.IP "\fB\-n, \-\-noheadings\fP"
Do not print a header line.
.IP "\fB\-o, \-\-output \fIlist\fP"
Specify which output columns to print.  Use
.B "--help"
to get a list of all supported columns.
.IP "\fB\-P, \-\-pairs\fP"
Use key="value" output format.
.IP "\fB\-r, \-\-raw\fP"
Use the raw output format.
.IP "\fB\-t, \-\-topology\fP"
Output info about block device topology.
This option is equivalent to "-o NAME,ALIGNMENT,MIN-IO,OPT-IO,PHY-SEC,LOG-SEC,ROTA,SCHED".
.SH NOTES
For the partitions are some information (e.g. queue attributes) inherited from
parental device.
.PP
The
.B lsblk
needs to be able to lookup sysfs path by major:minor, which is done
done by using
.BR /sys/dev/block .
The block sysfs appeared in kernel 2.6.27 (October 2008).  In case of
problem with new enough kernel check that CONFIG_SYSFS was enabled at
the time of kernel build.
