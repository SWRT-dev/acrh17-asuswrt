Two parameters denote the month (1 - 12) and year.
.PP
Three parameters denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be

The Gregorian Reformation is assumed to have occurred in 1752 on the 3rd of
September. By this time, most countries had recognized the reformation
(although a few did not recognize it until the early 1900's). Ten days
following that date were eliminated by the reformation, so the calendar for
that month is a bit unusual.
.SH HISTORY
A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.
.SH AVAILABILITY

ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.
