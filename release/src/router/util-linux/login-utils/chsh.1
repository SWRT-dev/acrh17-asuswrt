.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chsh
is used to change your login shell.
If a shell is not given on the command line,
.B chsh
prompts for one.

.B chsh
is used to change local entries only. Use ypchsh, lchsh or any other
implementation for non-local entries.
.SS VALID SHELLS
.B chsh
will accept the full pathname of any executable file on the system.
However, it will issue a warning if the shell is not listed in the

only accept shells listed in this file, unless you are root.
