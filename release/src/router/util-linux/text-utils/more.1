.SH NAME
more \- file perusal filter for crt viewing
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B more
[options] file [...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B more
is a filter for paging through text one screenful at a time.  This version is
especially primitive.  Users should realize that
.BR less (1)
provides
.BR more (1)
emulation plus extensive enhancements.
.SH OPTIONS
Command-line options are described below.  Options are also taken from the
environment variable
.B MORE
(make sure to precede them with a dash (``-'')) but command line options will
override them.
.It Fl num
.TP
.B \-number
This option specifies an integer
.I number
which is the screen size (in lines).
.TP
.B \-d
.B more
will prompt the user with the message "[Press space to continue, 'q' to
quit.]" and will display "[Press 'h' for instructions.]" instead of ringing
the bell when an illegal key is pressed.
.TP
.B \-l
.B more
usually treats
.B \&^L
(form feed) as a special character, and will pause after any line that
contains a form feed.  The
.B \-l
option will prevent this behavior.
.TP
.B -f
Causes
.B more
to count logical, rather than screen lines (i.e., long lines are not folded).
.TP
.B \-p
Do not scroll.  Instead, clear the whole screen and then display the text.
Notice that this option is switched on automatically if the executable is
named
.BR page .
.TP
.B \-c
Do not scroll.  Instead, paint each screen from the top, clearing the
remainder of each line as it is displayed.
.TP
.B \-s
Squeeze multiple blank lines into one.
.TP
.B \-u
Suppress underlining.
.TP
.B +/
The
.B +/
option specifies a string that will be searched for before each file is
displayed.
.TP
.B +number
Start at line
.IR number .
.SH COMMANDS
Interactive commands for
.B more
are based on
.BR vi (1).
Some commands may be preceded by a decimal number, called k in the
descriptions below.  In the following descriptions,
.B ^X
means
.BR control-X .
.PP
.RS
.PD 1
.TP 10
.BR h \ or \ ?
Help: display a summary of these commands.  If you forget all the other
commands, remember this one.
.TP
.B SPACE
Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen size.
.TP
.B z
Display next k lines of text.  Defaults to current screen size.  Argument
becomes new default.
.TP
.B RETURN

not pipes.
.TP
