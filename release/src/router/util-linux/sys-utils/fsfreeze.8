.TH FSFREEZE 8 "May 2010" "util-linux" "System Administration"
.SH NAME
fsfreeze \- suspend access to a filesystem (Linux Ext3/4, ReiserFS, JFS, XFS)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsfreeze \-f
.I mountpoint

.B fsfreeze \-u
.I mountpoint

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fsfreeze
suspends and resumes access to an filesystem
.PP
.B fsfreeze
halts new access to the filesystem and creates a stable image on disk.
.B fsfreeze
is intended to be used with hardware RAID devices that support the creation 
of snapshots.
.PP
.B fsfreeze
is unnecessary for
.B device-mapper
devices. The device-mapper (and LVM)
automatically freezes filesystem on the device when a snapshot creation is requested.
For more details see the
.BR dmsetup (8)
man page.
.PP
The
.I mount-point
argument is the pathname of the directory where the filesystem
is mounted.
The filesystem must be mounted to be frozen (see
.BR mount (8)).
.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB\-h, \-\-help\fP"
Print help and exit.
.IP "\fB\-f, \-\-freeze\fP"
This option requests the specified a filesystem to be frozen from new
modifications.  When this is selected, all ongoing transactions in the
filesystem are allowed to complete, new write system calls are halted, other
calls which modify the filesystem are halted, and all dirty data, metadata, and
log information are written to disk.  Any process attempting to write to the
frozen filesystem will block waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.

Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem can contain
information on files that are still in the process of unlinking.
These files will not be unlinked until the filesystem is unfrozen
or a clean mount of the snapshot is complete.
.IP "\fB\-u, \-\-unfreeze\fP
This option is used to un-freeze the filesystem and allow operations to
continue.  Any filesystem modifications that were blocked by the freeze are
unblocked and allowed to complete.
