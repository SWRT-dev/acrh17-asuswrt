INTRODUCTION
============

The NTFS-3G driver is an open source, freely available read/write NTFS driver 
for Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X, NetBSD, OpenSolaris, QNX and Haiku. It provides 
safe and fast handling of the Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, Windows 2000, 
Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 and Windows 7 file systems. 

The purpose of the project is to develop, quality assurance and support a 
trustable, featureful and high performance solution for hardware platforms 
and operating systems whose users need to reliably interoperate with NTFS. 
Besides this practical goal, the project also aims to explore the limits 
of the hybrid, kernel/user space filesystem driver approach, performance, 
reliability and feature richness per invested effort wise.

Besides the common file system features, NTFS-3G has support for file 
ownership and permissions, POSIX ACLs, junction points, extended attributes 
and creating compressed files. Parameter files in the directory .NTFS-3G may 
be required to enable them, please get the instructions from

News, support answers, problem submission instructions, support and discussion 
forums, performance numbers and other information are available on the project

QUICK INSTALLATION
==================

Linux: Make sure you have the basic development tools and the kernel includes 
the FUSE kernel module. Then unpack the source tarball and type:  

	./configure
	make
	make install      # or 'sudo make install' if you aren't root.

Please note that NTFS-3G doesn't require the FUSE user space package.

Non-Linux: Please see 

	http://www.tuxera.com/community/ntfs-3g-download/

for OS specific installation and source packages.


USAGE
=====

If there was no error during installation then the NTFS volume can be
read-write mounted for everybody the following way as the root user 
(unmount the volume if it was already mounted, and replace /dev/sda1 
and /mnt/windows, if needed):

	mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows
or
	ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /mnt/windows

Please see the ntfs-3g manual page for more options and examples.

You can also make NTFS to be mounted during boot by putting the below 
line at the END(!) of the /etc/fstab file:

	/dev/sda1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults 0 0
