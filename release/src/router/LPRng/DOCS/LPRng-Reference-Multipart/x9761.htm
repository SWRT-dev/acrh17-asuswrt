      <p>All HP LaserJet 4/5/6 family printers have a page count
      feature built into the firmware. However, this feature works
      differently depending on which HP LaserJet printer is being
      used. The following is a description of how the page count
      feature works for each printer within the HP LaserJet 4/5/6
      printer families.</p>

      <div class="INFORMALEXAMPLE">

    HP LaserJet 4P/4MP printers
    HP LaserJet 4Si/4Si MX printers
    HP LaserJet 4ML printers

      <p>All of the above printers use the same method for keeping
      track of the number of copies. There are really two different
      page count values: Primary and Secondary values. Every time a
      page is printed, whether it is an internal job (such as a
      self-test) or a standard print job, the Secondary page count
      increases by one. This value is stored in standard RAM. Once
      the Secondary page count value reaches 10, the Primary page
      count will increase by 10. The Primary page count value is
      stored in a type of memory called NVRAM (Non-Volatile RAM).
      This is important, since NVRAM is not cleared when the
      printer is powered off. Standard RAM, on the other hand, is
      cleared when the printer is turned off or reset. Thus, the
      Primary page count only increases in increments of 10.</p>

      <p>Example</p>

      <p>You have a brand new HP LaserJet 6P printer and you print
      a self-test page. When you look on the test page for the Page
      Count value, you will see that it says 1. Next, you decide to
      print a two page letter and, after that, another self-test.
      The page count value now says 4. Internally, the printers
      Secondary page count (stored in RAM) has the value of 4 while
      the Primary page count (stored in NVRAM) still has the value
      of 0. Now, you turn the printer off, then back on, and print
      another self-test. The page count value again says 1 since
      the previous value of 4, stored in RAM, was cleared when the
      printer was powered off. Finally, print a ten page document
      and then turn the printer off. Upon turning the printer back
      on and printing out another self test, you see that the page
      count value is 11. Internally, the Secondary page count value
      is back at 1 while the Primary page count value (stored in
      NVRAM) is 10. Added together, you end up with the resulting
      value seen on the self-test page.</p>

      <p>The HP LaserJet 4L/5L/6L printers differ from that of the
      other printers in that they do not have any NVRAM available
      for storing page count values. Thus, no way exists for the
      printer to retain a page count value once the printer is
      powered off. The HP LaserJet 4L/5L/6L printers have only a
      single page count value that increases in increments of one
      until the printer is powered off.</p>
