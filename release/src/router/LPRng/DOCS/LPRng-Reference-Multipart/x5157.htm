      Interface</a></h1>

      <p>The HP JetDirect Interface is one of the most widely used
      for network printers. For this reason it also has the most
      widely known set of problems. The user is strongly urged to
      upgrade to the latest version of firmware available for the
      unit. Problems with older versions of firmware include system
      lockups that require powerup level resets.</p>

      <p>Newer versions of the HP JetDirect Interface have a Web
      Browser based configuration system. After you have assigned
      an IP address to the printer you can connect to the
      configuration port and configure the printer using the
      browser. If you run into configuration problems then you will
      most likely need to use the Microsoft Windows based JetDirect
      Configuration Software to reset or reconfigure the
      printer.</p>

      <p>Older HPJetDirect cards can be configured only through
      through the front panel or through a set of network files.
      Here is a summary of the methods used from UNIX systems, or
      to use when you are desperate, to configure the printer.</p>

        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="AEN5162">11.7.1. Resetting To
        Factory Defaults</a></h2>

        <p>Most internal HP JetDirect print servers can be reset to
        factory defaults (or cold-reset) by turning the printer off
        and holding down the <var class="LITERAL">Online</var> or
        <var class="LITERAL">Go</var> button while turning the
        printer back on. The printer control panel display should
        read <var class="LITERAL">Cold Reset</var>, <var class=
        "LITERAL">Restoring Factory Settings</var>, or something
        similar.</p>

        Networking and Address</a></h2>

        <p>You can set the network address from the front panel.
        Reset the printer, put it in offline mode. and then use the
        MENU, +-, SELECT keys as follows:</p>

     ITEM  -&gt; TIMEOUT=90
          This is the connection timeout value.  It puts a limit
         on time between connections.  A value of 10 is reasonable.

        <p>If you have a bootp server, you can put this information
        in the bootptab file. To use this, you must enable the
        bootp option on the printer. The T144 option specifies a
        file to be read from the bootp server. This file is read by
        using the TFTP protocol, and you must have a TFTPD server
        enabled. Here is a sample bootptab entry.</p>

    # to the peripheral.  The mask usually matches the network or subnet
    # mask, but this is not required.  If netnum is a host IP address,

    # size.  The card will use a TCP MSS of 1460 bytes for local hosts,
    # and 536 bytes for a non-local host.  The default is off, that is,
    # the card will use the maximum packet sizes only on the card's
