      Server Boxes</a></h1>

      <p>A <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">network print
      server</i></span> is usually a box (external model) or card
      in a printer (internal model) which has a network connection
      to a TCP network and software to implement a LPD print
      server. If it is an external model, The parallel or serial
      port of the printer is connected to the box, and the print
      server may support multiple printers. If it is an internal
      model, the server is usually nothing more than a Network
      Interface Controller and a ROM containing software that the
      microprocessor in the printer uses.</p>

      <p>The print server may support multiple printing protocols,
      such as <a href="rfc1179.htm">RFC1179</a> (TCP/IP printing
      using the LPD print protocol), Novell Printer Protocols, SMB
      print protocols, and AppleTalk protocols. One of the observed
      problems with Network Print servers is that while they can
      usually support one protocol and one user at a time quite
      well, when you try to use multiple protocols and/or multiple
      users try to transfer print jobs to the printer, the printer
      may behave in a very odd manner. Usually this results in a
      printer failing to finish a job currently being printed, and
      unable to accept new jobs.</p>

      <p>Several of the newer models of print servers have Simple
      Network Management Protocol (SNMP) agents built into them,
      and can provide detailed information about their internal
      functions. By using a SNMP manager such as SunNetmanage or
      HP-Openview, you can monitor your network printers
      activities.</p>

      <p>I recommend that you use only a single protocol to send
      jobs to the printer. If you can, I also recommend that you
      use a print spooler and have only a single host system send a
      job to the printer.</p>

      <p>My best advice on connecting to network printers is not to
      use the the built-in LPD server, but to use the direct TCP/IP
      connection to the print engine. Usually this is done to
      particular TCP/IP port on the printer. For the HP JetDirect
      and other HP products, this is usually TCP port 9100.</p>

      <p>Once you have the direct connection, you can now use
      various filters to preprocess the print job, insert PJL and
      PCL commands, or convert text to PostScript or PCL for better
      print quality.</p>
