      Codes</a></h1>

      <p>When a filter exits, the exit code value is used by the
      parent process to determine what actions to take. Since
      filters are used in several places in the printing process,
      not just to do format conversion, there is a large number of
      recognized exit values.</p>

<pre class="SCREEN">
    Key      Value   Meaning
    JSUCC    0       Successful
    JFAIL    1, 32   Failed - retry later

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JSUCC">16.2.1. JSUCC</a></h2>

        <p>A zero or <acronym class="ACRONYM">JSUCC</acronym> exit
        value always indicates success; a non-zero exit value
        indicates failure or a problem condition and requires
        special handling by the parent process.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JFAIL">16.2.2. JFAIL</a></h2>

        <p>When printing or performing some action that can be
        repeated, such as connecting to a remote printer, a 1 or
        <acronym class="ACRONYM">JFAIL</acronym> status indicates a
        transient failure condition. Depending on various
        configuration options, the printing or other operation can
        be retried.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JABORT">16.2.3. JABORT</a></h2>

        <p>The 2 or <acronym class="ACRONYM">JABORT</acronym> is a
        more serious error, and indicates that there is no
        expectation that the operation would succeed if retried. It
        may also indicate that no other similar operation should be
        performed. Jobs whose print filters exit with <acronym
        class="ACRONYM">JABORT</acronym> are usually unprintable,
        and by default are removed from the print queue.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JREMOVE">16.2.4.
        JREMOVE</a></h2>

        <p>The <acronym class="ACRONYM">JREMOVE</acronym> status
        indicates that the job should be removed from the print
        queue. This is a refinement of the <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JFAIL</acronym> and <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JABORT</acronym> status. The job is usually
        unconditionally removed from the print queue, even if it is
        normally kept in the queue for reprinting. This status is
        usually returned by filters which are responsible for
        permission checking and is returned when the user has no
        permission to print.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JHOLD">16.2.5. JHOLD</a></h2>

        <p>The <acronym class="ACRONYM">JREMOVE</acronym> status
        indicates that the job should be held and reprinted at a
        later time. This status is returned by various filters
        during the processing of a job, and usually indicates that
        the resources needed for a job are not available. Held jobs
        need to be explicitly released by the administrator.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JNOSPOOL">16.2.6. JNOSPOOL and
        JNOPRINT</a></h2>

        <p>The <acronym class="ACRONYM">JNOSPOOL</acronym> and
        <acronym class="ACRONYM">JNOPRINT</acronym> are used as
        part of the management of load balancing queues and the
        <span class="emphasis"><i class="EMPHASIS">check
        idle</i></span> filter. <b class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b>
        has the ability to run a program to check to see if a spool
        queue is available for printing on a dynamic basis. If the
        filter that does this checking exits with <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JNOSPOOL</acronym> or <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JNOPRINT</acronym> then jobs should not be sent
        to the spool queue.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JSIGNAL">16.2.7.
        JSIGNAL</a></h2>

        <p>This status is usually returned when the exiting process
        is terminated by a signal or abort, and does not exit using
        the <var class="LITERAL">exit</var> facility. It is usually
        handled like a <acronym class="ACRONYM">JABORT</acronym>
        exit status, and is the indication of a severe and possibly
        non-restartable system failure.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JNORETRY">16.2.8.
        JFAILNORETRY</a></h2>

        <p>This code is used under an extremely odd set of
        circumstances and was used to support a sophisticated print
        retry system.</p>

        <p>Normally when a print filter or other filter returns
        this code, it is treated as <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JFAIL</acronym>. The job is marked as having an
        error condition and is not <var class=
        "LITERAL">immediately</var> retried. Other jobs can then be
        tried for printing in the queue. It is not removed from the
        print queue, but marked as <var class=
        "LITERAL">unprintable</var>.</p>

        <p>When a <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">round-robin retry</i></span> print scheduling
        algorithm is used, if there are no other jobs available for
        printing then the jobs that failed with <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JFAILNORETRY</acronym> are retried. Thus, jobs
        that are submitted go to the head of the queue for
        printing, and jobs that are pending for repeat are printed
        after them. This algorithm is deprecated, and that the
        details of this algorithm are undocumented.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="SECT2">
        <h2 class="SECT2"><a name="JOTHER">16.2.9. Other
        Values</a></h2>

        <p>If a filter exits with other than the indicated value,
        or a value inappropriate for its purpose, then the result
        is treated like <acronym class=
        "ACRONYM">JABORT</acronym>.</p>
