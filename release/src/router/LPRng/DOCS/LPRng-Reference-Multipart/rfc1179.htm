      the Line Printer Daemon Protocol?</a></h1>

      <p>RFC1179 defines a standard method by which print jobs can
      be transferred using the TCP/IP protocol between hosts. The
      standard was developed by simply detailing the way that a
      version of the BSD <b class="APPLICATION">lpd</b> software
      did its job.</p>

      <p>From the RFC Introduction: <a name="AEN10820"></a></p>

      <blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
        <p>RFC 1179 describes a print server protocol widely used
        on the Internet for communicating between line printer
        daemons (both clients and servers). RFC1179 is for
        informational purposes only, and does not specify an
        Internet standard.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>Having said this, the RFC then goes on to describe the
      protocol used by a particular implementation of <b class=
      "APPLICATION">lpd</b>. The problem was that the RFC did not
      provide any way to put extensions to the operations into the
      system, and failed to specify such interesting details as the
      order in which print jobs and their components could be
      transferred.</p>

      <p>Comment by Patrick Powell <var class=
      "LITERAL">&lt;papowell@lprng.com&gt;</var> : <a name=
      "AEN10826"></a></p>

      <blockquote class="BLOCKQUOTE">
        <p>Since 1988, there have been a large number of print
        spooling systems developed which claim RFC1179 conformance,
        but which are mutually incompatible.</p>

        <p>Rather than live with the limited capabilities of the
        RFC1179 standard, <b class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b> has
        extended them by adding capabilities to perform remote
        control of print spoolers, encrypted and authenticated data
        transfers, and other operations missing from the RFC1179
        specification. However, great effort was made to be
        backwards compatible with older and other <b class=
        "APPLICATION">lpd</b> based systems.</p>

        <p><b class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b> was developed in order
        to be able to both accept and provide interactions with
        these systems. It does so by allowing various options to be
        used to <span class="emphasis"><i class=
        "EMPHASIS">tune</i></span> how print jobs would be
        exchanged. Currently, <b class="APPLICATION">LPRng</b> can
        be configured to send and receive print jobs between a vast
        number of the existing spooling systems. It is flexible
        enough to act as a gateway between non-compatible systems,
        and has provisions to transform jobs from one format to
        another in a dynamic manner.</p>
