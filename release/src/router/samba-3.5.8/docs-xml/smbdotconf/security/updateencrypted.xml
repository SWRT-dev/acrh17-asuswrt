    <para>
	This boolean parameter allows a user logging on with a plaintext password to have their encrypted (hashed)
	password in the smbpasswd file to be updated automatically as they log on. This option allows a site to
	migrate from plaintext password authentication (users authenticate with plaintext password over the
	wire, and are checked against a UNIX account database) to encrypted password authentication (the SMB
	challenge/response authentication mechanism) without forcing all users to re-enter their passwords via
	smbpasswd at the time the change is made. This is a convenience option to allow the change over to encrypted
	passwords to be made over a longer period.  Once all users have encrypted representations of their passwords
	in the smbpasswd file this parameter should be set to <constant>no</constant>.
	</para>

    <para>
	In order for this parameter to be operative the <smbconfoption name="encrypt passwords"/> parameter must 
    be set to <constant>no</constant>. The default value of <smbconfoption name="encrypt
	passwords">Yes</smbconfoption>. Note: This must be set to <constant>no</constant> for this <smbconfoption
	name="update encrypted"/> to work.
	</para>

    <para>
	Note that even when this parameter is set, a user authenticating to <command moreinfo="none">smbd</command>
	must still enter a valid password in order to connect correctly, and to update their hashed (smbpasswd)
	passwords.
