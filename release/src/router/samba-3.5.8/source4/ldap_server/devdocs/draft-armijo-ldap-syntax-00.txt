1. Status of this Memo


This memo provides information for the Internet community. It does not specify 
an Internet standard of any kind. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

This document is an Internet-Draft. Internet-Drafts are working documents of the 
Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), its areas, and its working groups. Note 
that other groups may also distribute working documents as Internet-Drafts. 

Internet-Drafts are draft documents valid for a maximum of six months and may be 
updated, replaced, or obsoleted by other documents at any time. It is 
inappropriate to use Internet- Drafts as reference material or to cite them 
other than as "work in progress." 

To view the entire list of current Internet-Drafts, please check the "1id-
abstracts.txt" listing contained in the Internet-Drafts Shadow Directories on

2. Abstract

The purpose of this document is to inform the Internet community of LDAP 
syntaxes available in the Windows NT Active Directory.  These syntaxes provide
additional functionality to the Active Directory.


3. RFC Key Words

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", 
"SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be 
interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


4. LDAP Syntaxes

CaseIgnoreString: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.905
	Encoded as a Printable String (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.44)


OR-Name: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.1221
	Encoded as:
 	ORName = DN | "X400:" ORaddress "#X500:" DN | "X400:"ORaddress 
	DN = normally encoded rfc 1779 name
	ORaddress = some string encoding for OR addresses.  
	
Note that an unescaped # character must not be legal in this encoding.  
This is necessary to be able to identify where the #X500 starts if the 
middle choice of the encoding is chosen.

	
DNWithOctetString: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.903
	Encoded as a :
	DNWithOctetString  = OctetTag ':' Count ':' OctetString ':' DN
	OctetTag = 'B' | 'b'
	Count = positive decimal number, counting number of encoded characters 
		in OctetString
	OctetString = [EncodedByte]*  // Note: the number of characters in the
		string encoding of the OctetString is Count.
	EncodedByte = [0-9 | a-f | A-F] [0-9 | a-f | A-F]
	DN = <normal string encoding of a DN> 

	As an example, the string encoding of the combination of 0x74 0x65 0x73 
	0x74 and DC=Microsoft,DC=Com is

	B:8:74657374:DC=Microsoft,DC=Com

	
DNWithString: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.904
	Encoded as a :
	DNWithString  = StringTag ':' Count ':' String ':' DN
	OctetTag = 'S' | 's'
	Count = positive decimal number, counting number of bytes in String
	String = <normally encoded (i.e. UTF8 for V3) string>  // Note: the number 
	of bytes in the string encoding of the String is Count. 
 
	DN = <normal string encoding of a DN> 

	As an example, the string encoding of the combination of "test" and 
	DC=Microsoft,DC=Com is

	B:4:test:DC=Microsoft,DC=Com

	As an example, the string encoding of the combination of XYZ (where X, Y, 
	and Z all have two byte UTF-8 encodings) and DC=Microsoft,DC=Com is

	B:6:XYZ:DC=Microsoft,DC=Com

Note: Characters with multibyte UTF-8 encodings contribute more than one to the count


Large-Integer: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.906
	Encoded as an Integer (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.27), but guaranteed 
	to support 64 bit numbers.


Object-Security-Descriptor: 1.2.840.113556.1.4.907
	Encoded as an Octet-String (OID 1.3.6.1.4.1.1466.115.121.1.40)
