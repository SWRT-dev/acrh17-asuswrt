- use pkg-config files in the buildsystem?
- let the build system implement some make functions($(patsubst),$(wildcard),...) and use our own implementations where `make' does not support them
- include extra_flags.txt using Makefile construction if 
  supported by current make
- fix shared module loading for selftest during builds without install
- remove recursive dependency between LIBSOCKET, LIBCLI_NBT and LIBCLI_RESOLVE
- clearer distinction between dcerpc and ndr. seperate interface tables? Maybe get rid of 
  NDR's table altogether and use dlopen/dlsym ?
- saner names for:
	libcli.so.0.0.1 (rename to libsmb?)
	libcli_cldap.so.0.0.1 (rename to libcldap?)
	libcli_nbt.so.0.0.1 (rename to libnbt?)
	libcli_wrepl.so.0.0.1 (rename to libwrepl?)
- generate headermap.txt

set of test scripts that check the code:
- configure_check_unused.pl
- find_unused_macros.pl
- find_unused_makefilevars.pl
- find_unused_options.sh
- findstatic.pl
- minimal_includes.pl
- check dependencies based on #include lines ?
- check whether private headers are not used outside their own subsystem
- undocumented (no manpage) installed binaries
