			Defines the available matching uid and gid range for which the
			backend is authoritative. Note that the range acts as a filter.
			If algorithmically determined UID or GID fall outside the
			range, they are ignored and the corresponding map is discarded.
			It is intended as a way to avoid accidental UID/GID overlaps
			between local and remotely defined IDs.
		</p></dd><dt><span class="term">base_rid = INTEGER</span></dt><dd><p>
			Defines the base integer used to build SIDs out of a UID or a GID,
			and to rebase the UID or GID to be obtained from a SID.
			This means SIDs with a RID less than the base rid are filtered.
			The default is not to restrict the allowed rids at all,
			i.e. a base_rid value of 0.
			A good value for the base_rid can be 1000, since user
			RIDs by default start at 1000 (512 hexadecimal).
		</p><p>
			Use of this parameter is deprecated.

		The Unix ID for a RID is calculated this way:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			ID = RID - BASE_RID + LOW_RANGE_ID.
		</pre><p>
	</p><p>
		Correspondingly, the formula for calculating the RID for a
		given Unix ID is this:
		</p><pre class="programlisting">
			RID = ID + BASE_RID - LOW_RANGE_ID.
		</pre><p>
	</p></div><div class="refsect1" lang="en"><a name="id2483358"></a><h2>EXAMPLES</h2><p>
		This example shows how to configure two domains with idmap_rid,
		the principal domain and a trusted domain, leaving the default
		id mapping scheme at tdb. The example also demonstrates the use
		of the base_rid parameter for the trusted domain.
