A transport connection between the hosts <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
The host <b>moon</b> starts the Trusted Key Manager (TKM) and the Ada XFRM
proxy, which relays XFRM kernel messages to charon. The authentication is based
on X.509 certificates. The connection is initiated by a ping from <b>moon</b>
to <b>sun</b>. The test asserts that a rekeying initiated by <b>sun</b> works
as expected.
