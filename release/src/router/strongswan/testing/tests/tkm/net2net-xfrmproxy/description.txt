A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b>
is set up. The host <b>moon</b> starts the Trusted Key Manager (TKM) and the Ada
XFRM proxy, which relays XFRM kernel messages to charon. The authentication is
based on X.509 certificates. In order to test the tunnel, client <b>alice</b>
behind gateway <b>moon</b> pings client <b>bob</b> located behind gateway
<b>sun</b>.
