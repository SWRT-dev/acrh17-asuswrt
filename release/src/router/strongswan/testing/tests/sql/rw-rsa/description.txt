The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>raw RSA public keys</b>
with <b>ID_RFC822_ADDR</b> and <b>ID_FQDN</b> identities for the roadwarriors and
gateway, respectively.
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, automatically inserted
iptables-based firewall rules let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
