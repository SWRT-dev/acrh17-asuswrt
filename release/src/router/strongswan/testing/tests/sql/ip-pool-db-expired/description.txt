The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> start a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration
payload. The gateway moon assigns expired virtual IP addresses from a pool named <b>bigpool</b>
predefined in the SQL database. 
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, automatically inserted
iptables-based firewall rules let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
