The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
<p/>
In a next step the <b>RFC 7171 PT-EAP</b> transport protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS
tunnel to determine the health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>IF-TNCCS 2.0 </b>
client-server interface compliant with <b>RFC 5793 PB-TNC</b>. The IMCs and IMVs exchange
messages over the <b>IF-M</b> protocol defined by <b>RFC 5792 PA-TNC</b>.
<p>
The first time the TNC clients <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> send their measurements,
TNC server <b>moon</b> requests a handshake retry. In the retry <b>carol</b> succeeds
and <b>dave</b> fails. Thus based on this second round of measurements the clients are connected
by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate" subnets, respectively.
