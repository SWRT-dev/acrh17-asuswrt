The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the client doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> via the <b>TNCCS 2.0 </b> client-server interface
compliant with <b>RFC 5793 PB-TNC</b>.
<p/>
Unfortunately <b>moon</b> sends his first PB-TNC batch with a wrong version number .
Therefore the connection setup fails due to a fatal PB-TNC error.
