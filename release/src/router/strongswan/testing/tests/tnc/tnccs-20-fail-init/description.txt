The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> via the <b>TNCCS 2.0 </b> client-server interface
compliant with <b>RFC 5793 PB-TNC</b>.
<p/>
Unfortunately <b>carol</b> sends her first PB-TNC batch with a wrong version number and
<b>dave</b> sends a PB-TNC message not supported by <b>moon</b> with the NOSKIP flag set.
Therefore both connection setups fail due to fatal PB-TNC errors.
