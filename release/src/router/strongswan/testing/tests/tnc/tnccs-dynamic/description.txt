The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>
using EAP-TTLS authentication only with the gateway presenting a server certificate and
the clients doing EAP-MD5 password-based authentication.
<p/>
In a next step the EAP-TNC protocol is used within the EAP-TTLS tunnel to determine the
health of TNC client <b>carol</b> via the <b>TNCCS 1.1 </b> client-server interface and of
TNC client <b>dave</b> via the <b>TNCCS 2.0 </b> client-server interface. TNC server
<b>moon</b> dynamically detects which version of the IF-TNCCS protocol is used.
<p>
<b>carol</b> passes the health test and <b>dave</b> fails. Based on these measurements the
clients are connected by gateway <b>moon</b> to the "rw-allow" and "rw-isolate" subnets,
respectively.
