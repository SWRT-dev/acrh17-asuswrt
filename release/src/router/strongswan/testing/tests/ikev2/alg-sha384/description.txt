Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes to gateway <b>moon</b> the ESP cipher suite
<b>AES_CBC_192 / HMAC_SHA2_384_192</b> by defining <b>esp=aes192-sha384-curve25519!</b>
in ipsec.conf. The same cipher suite is used for IKE.
A ping from <b>carol</b> to <b>alice</b> successfully checks the established tunnel.
