The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
Both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> request a <b>virtual IP</b> via the IKEv2 configuration payload
by using the <b>leftsourceip=%config</b> parameter. <b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic. In order to test the
tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway
<b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings will be the virtual IPs <b>carol1</b>
and <b>dave1</b>, respectively.
