The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>alice</b>, which identifies itself as <b>mars</b>.
Host <b>venus</b> in the subnet behind this gateway uses gateway <b>moon</b> as
default gateway, so it is not fully reachable by the two roadwarriors.
Then both SAs are actively redirected with the <em>swanctl --redirect</em>
command to gateway <b>moon</b> (also identified as <b>mars</b>) using the
mechanism described in <b>RFC 5685</b> enabling the roadwarriors to
ping <b>venus</b>.
