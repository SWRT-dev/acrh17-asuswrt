The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to
gateway <b>moon</b> and request a <b>virtual IP</b>. <b>moon</b> negotiates
broadcast and multicast traffic selectors with the clients, and uses
<i>%unique</i> marks to avoid any policy conflicts. The enabled <i>forecast</i>
plugin on <b>moon</b> installs the required Netfilter rules to make use of these
policies, and additionally starts forwarding broadcast and multicast packets
between the clients.<br/>
To test forwarding, the hosts send multicast and broadcast ping messages.
