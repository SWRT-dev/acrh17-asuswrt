Roadwarrior <b>carol</b> proposes to gateway <b>moon</b> the cipher suite
<b>AES_CCM_12_128</b> both for IKE and ESP by defining <b>ike=aes128ccm12-aesxcbc-curve25519</b>
(or alternatively <b>aes128ccm96</b>) and <b>esp=aes128ccm12-curve25519</b> in ipsec.conf, respectively.
A ping from <b>carol</b> to <b>alice</b> successfully checks the established tunnel.
