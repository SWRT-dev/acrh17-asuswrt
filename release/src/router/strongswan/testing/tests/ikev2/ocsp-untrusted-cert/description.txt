By setting <b>strictcrlpolicy=yes</b>, a <b>strict</b> CRL policy is enforced on
both roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and gateway <b>moon</b>. The online certificate status
is checked via the OCSP server <b>winnetou</b> which is sending its <b>self-signed</b>
OCSP signer certificate. A strongswan <b>ca</b> section in ipsec.conf
defines an <b>OCSP URI</b> pointing to <b>winnetou</b>.
<p>
<b>carol</b> cannot successfully initiate an IPsec connection to <b>moon</b> since
the self-signed certificate contained in the OCSP response will not be
accepted by <b>moon</b>.
