The peers <b>carol</b>, <b>dave</b>, and <b>moon</b> all have dynamic IP addresses,
so that the remote end is defined symbolically by <b>right=%&lt;hostname&gt;</b>.
The ipsec starter resolves the fully-qualified hostname into the current IP address
via a DNS lookup (simulated by an /etc/hosts entry). Since the peer IP addresses are
expected to change over time, the prefix '%' is used as an implicit alternative to the
explicit <b>rightallowany=yes</b> option which will allow an IKE_SA rekeying to arrive
from an arbitrary IP address under the condition that the peer identity remains unchanged.
When this happens the old tunnel is replaced by an IPsec connection to the new origin.
<p>
In this scenario both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> initiate a tunnel to
<b>moon</b> which has a named connection definition for each peer. Although
the IP addresses of both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> are stale, thanks to
the '%' prefix <b>moon</b> will accept the IKE negotiations from the actual IP addresses.
