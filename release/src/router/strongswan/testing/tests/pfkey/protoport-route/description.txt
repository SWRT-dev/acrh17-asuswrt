Using the <b>left|rightprotoport</b> selectors, two IPsec tunnels 
between the roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and the gateway <b>moon</b> are
defined. The first IPsec SA is restricted to ICMP packets and the second
covers TCP-based SSH connections. Using <b>add=route</b> %trap
eroutes for these IPsec SAs are prepared on <b>carol</b>. By sending
a ping to the client <b>alice</b> behind <b>moon</b>, the ICMP eroute
is triggered and the corresponding IPsec tunnel is set up. In the same
way an ssh session to <b>alice</b> over the second IPsec SA is established.
