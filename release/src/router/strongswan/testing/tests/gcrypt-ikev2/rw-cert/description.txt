The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and the gateway <b>moon</b> use the <b>gcrypt</b>
plugin based on the <b>GNU Libgcrypt</b> library for all cryptographical functions
whereas roadwarrior <b>dave</b> uses the default <b>strongSwan</b> cryptographical
plugins <b>aes des sha1 sha2 md5 gmp</b>.
<p>
The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each 
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the <b>updown</b> directive
in swanctl.conf automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the
tunneled traffic. In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and
<b>dave</b> ping the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
