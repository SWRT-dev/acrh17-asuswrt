The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The authentication is based on RSA signatures (<b>RSASIG</b>) using X.509 certificates
followed by extended authentication (<b>XAUTH</b>) of <b>carol</b> based on a user name
equal to the <b>IKEv1</b> identity (<b>carol@strongswan.org</b>) and a user password
defined and stored by <b>carol</b> in ipsec.secrets. Gateway <b>moon</b> starts
an EAP-RADIUS connection with AAA server <b>alice</b> and uses <b>carol</b>'s 
forwarded XAUTH user credentials for an EAP-MD5 based client authentication with
<b>alice</b>.
