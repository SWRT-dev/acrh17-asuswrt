The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each to gateway <b>moon</b>.
The gateway pushes <b>virtual IP</b> addresses to <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b>via the IKEv1
Mode Config protocol in <b>push</b> mode.
<p/>
<b>leftfirewall=yes</b> automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the
tunneled traffic. In order to test the tunnels, <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> then ping the
client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>. The source IP addresses of the two pings
will be the virtual IPs <b>carol1</b> and <b>dave1</b>, respectively.
