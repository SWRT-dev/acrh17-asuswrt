An IPv6 ESP transport connection between the hosts <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is
successfully set up. The authentication is based on X.509 certificates. Upon the
successful establishment of the IPsec SA, automatically inserted ip6tables-based
firewall rules let pass the protected traffic. In order to test both the transport
connection and the firewall rules, <b>moon</b> sends an IPv6 ICMP request to
<b>sun</b> using the ping6 command.
