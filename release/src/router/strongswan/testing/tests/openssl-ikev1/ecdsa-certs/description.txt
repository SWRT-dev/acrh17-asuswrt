The hosts <b>carol</b>, <b>dave</b>, and <b>moon</b> use the <b>openssl</b> plugin
based on the <b>OpenSSL</b> library for all cryptographical and X.509 certificate functions.
<p>
The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>ECDSA signatures</b>
using <b>Elliptic Curve certificates</b>.

Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
