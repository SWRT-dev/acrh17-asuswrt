The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and the gateway <b>moon</b> use the <b>openssl</b>
plugin based on the <b>OpenSSL</b> library for all cryptographical and X.509
certificate functions whereas roadwarrior <b>dave</b> uses the default <b>strongSwan</b>
cryptographical plugins <b>aes des sha1 sha2 hmac gmp x509</b> plus the <b>openssl</b>
plugin for the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman groups only.
<p>
The roadwarriors <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> set up a connection each
to gateway <b>moon</b>. The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>.
<b>carol</b> proposes the <b>Brainpool</b> DH groups ECP_384_BP and ECP_224_BP whereas
<b>dave</b> proposes ECP_384_BP and ECP_256_BP. Since <b>moon</b> does not support
ECP_384_BP the roadwarriors fall back to ECP_224_BP and ECP_256_BP, respectively.
<p>
Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script automatically
inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
