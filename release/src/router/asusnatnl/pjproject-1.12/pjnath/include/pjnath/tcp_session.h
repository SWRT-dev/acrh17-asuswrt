@{

The \ref PJNATH_TCP_SESSION is a transport-independent object to
manage a client TCP session. It contains the core logic for manage
the TCP client session as listed in \ref tcp_op_sec, but
in transport-independent manner (i.e. it doesn't have a socket), so
that developer can integrate TCP client functionality into existing
framework that already has its own means to send and receive data,
or to support new transport types to TCP, such as TLS.


\section tcp_sess_using_sec Using the TCP session

These steps describes how to use the TCP session:

 - <b>Creating the session</b>:\n
   use #pj_tcp_session_create() to create the session. 

 - <b>Configuring credential</b>:\n
   all TCP operations requires the use of authentication (it uses STUN 
   long term autentication method). Use #pj_tcp_session_set_credential()
   to configure the TCP credential to be used by the session.

 - <b>Configuring server</b>:\n
   application must call #pj_tcp_session_set_server() before it can send
   Allocate request (with pj_tcp_session_alloc()). This function will
   resolve the TCP server using DNS SRV resolution if the \a resolver
   is set. The server resolution process will complete asynchronously,
   and application will be notified in \a on_state() callback of the 
   #pj_tcp_session_cb structurewith the session state set to 
   PJ_TCP_STATE_RESOLVED.

 - <b>Creating allocation</b>:\n
   create one "relay port" (or called <b>relayed-transport-address</b>
   in TCP terminology) in the TCP server by using #pj_tcp_session_alloc().
   This will send Allocate request to the server. This function will complete
   immediately, and application will be notified about the allocation
   result in the \a on_state() callback of the #pj_tcp_session_cb structure.

 - <b>Getting the allocation result</b>:\n
   if allocation is successful, the session state will progress to
   \a PJ_TCP_STATE_READY, otherwise the state will be 
   \a PJ_TCP_STATE_DEALLOCATED or higher. Session state progression is
   reported in the \a on_state() callback of the #pj_tcp_session_cb 
   structure. On successful allocation, application may retrieve the
   allocation info by calling #pj_tcp_session_get_info().

 - <b>Sending data through the relay</b>.\n
   Once allocation has been created, client may send data to any remote 
   endpoints (called peers in TCP terminology) via the "relay port". It does
   so by calling #pj_tcp_session_sendto(), giving the peer address 
   in the function argument. But note that at this point peers are not allowed
   to send data towards the client (via the "relay port") before permission is
   installed for that peer.

 - <b>Creating permissions</b>.\n
   Permission needs to be created in the TCP server so that a peer can send 
   data to the client via the relay port (a peer in this case is identified by
   its IP address). Without this, when the TCP server receives data from the
   peer in the "relay port", it will drop this data. Create the permission by
   calling #pj_tcp_session_set_perm(), specifying the peer IP address in the
   argument (the port part of the address is ignored). More than one IP 
   addresses may be specified.

 - <b>Receiving data from peers</b>.\n
   Once permission has been installed for the peer, any data received by the 
   TCP server (from that peer) in the "relay port" will be relayed back to 
   client by the server, and application will be notified via \a on_rx_data
   callback of the #pj_tcpl_session_cb.

 - <b>Using ChannelData</b>.\n
   TCP provides optimized framing to the data by using ChannelData 
   packetization. The client activates this format for the specified peer by
   calling #pj_tcp_session_bind_channel(). Data sent or received to/for
   this peer will then use ChannelData format instead of Send or Data 
   Indications.

 - <b>Refreshing the allocation, permissions, and channel bindings</b>.\n
   Allocations, permissions, and channel bindings will be refreshed by the
   session automatically when they about to expire.

 - <b>Destroying the allocation</b>.\n
   Once the "relay port" is no longer needed, client destroys the allocation
   by calling #pj_tcp_session_shutdown(). This function will return
   immediately, and application will be notified about the deallocation
   result in the \a on_state() callback of the #pj_tcp_session_cb structure.
   Once the state has reached PJ_TCP_STATE_DESTROYING, application must
   assume that the session will be destroyed shortly after.
